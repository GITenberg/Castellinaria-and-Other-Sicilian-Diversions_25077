9</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>It is probable that every book contains, besides misprints,
some statements which the author would be glad to modify if he
could.&nbsp; In Chapter V of <i>Diversions in Sicily</i> it is
stated that the seating arrangements of the marionette theatre in
Catania would be condemned by the County Council, which I believe
to be correct, but, on visiting the theatre since, I find I was
wrong in saying that there are no passages; I did not see them on
my first visit because the audience hid them.</p>
<p>Again, in Chapter XVI it is stated that Giovanni Grasso enters
in the third act of <i>La Morte Civile</i>, whereas he enters in
the second act.&nbsp; I have since seen the play several times,
and, though it is tedious, it is not so much so as to justify a
spectator in thinking any of its acts long enough for two.</p>
<p>In Chapter IV I say that the Government makes an annual profit
of &pound;3,000,000 sterling out of the lottery, but I do not say
whether this profit is gross or net.&nbsp; There is a paragraph
in the <i>Morning Post</i>, 12 September, 1911, which states
clearly that never since the union of Italy has the State lottery
been so productive as in the present year of Jubilee; the gross
yield has been &pound;3,715,088, and the net <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>gain, after
deducting commissions and prizes, &pound;1,489,180.</p>
<p>In Chapter XV it is stated that the words of the play in
Signor Greco&rsquo;s marionette theatre in Palermo are always
improvised except in the case of <i>Samson</i>.&nbsp; This is
incorrect.&nbsp; The words of the long play about the paladins
are improvised, but they have in the theatre the MSS. of several
religious plays by the author of <i>Samson</i>, who was a
Palermitan, Filippo Orioles.&nbsp; All who are interested in the
legends, folklore, popular entertainments, superstitions, and
traditions of the people of Sicily are under deep obligations to
Giuseppe Pitr&egrave;, of Palermo, Professore di Demopsicologia,
for his numerous volumes treating of those subjects.&nbsp; In
<i>Spettacoli e Feste Popolari Siciliane</i> he gives the little
that is known of Filippo Orioles, who died in 1793 at the great
age of one hundred and six years.&nbsp; The subject of the most
famous of his plays is the Passion of Jesus Christ, and its title
in English signifies The Redemption of Adam.&nbsp; It has had an
immense success throughout Sicily; it has been copied in MS. many
times, printed continually, performed over and over again in
theatres, in churches, in the public squares, and in private
houses.&nbsp; It was written for living actors, and Signor Greco
considers it too long for a performance by marionettes, so when
they do it in his teatrino they treat it even more freely than
our London managers treat a play by Shakespeare.&nbsp; Copies are
difficult to procure because their owners keep them
jealously.&nbsp; <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Professore Pitr&egrave; has, however,
lately added to our obligations by publishing a reprint of the
play: <i>Il Riscatto d&rsquo;Adamo nella Morte di Ges&ugrave;
Cristo</i>; Tragedia di Filippo Orioles, Palermitano; Riprodotta
sulla edizione di 1750; con prefazione di G. Pitr&egrave;.&nbsp;
Palermo: Tipografia Vittoria Giliberti, Via Celso 93.&nbsp;
1909.&nbsp; A copy of this reprint is in the library of the
British Museum.</p>
<p>Many of the friends who have helped me to write this book are
named in the following pages, many more are unnamed.&nbsp; I
hereby tender my thanks to all of them.</p>
<p>I specially thank Signor Cesare Coppo, of Casale-Monferrato,
who, although he is not a Sicilian, has helped me in a manner
which I will only hint at by saying that he could give a better
account than I can of Peppino Pampalone, of Castellinaria.</p>
<p>To an English friend, Mr. Joseph Benwell Clark, I am indebted
for the drawing on the title-page and on the cover.&nbsp; When
any of the audience leaves Signor Greco&rsquo;s marionette
theatre in Palermo to smoke a cigarette or to drink a glass of
water between the acts he receives a ticket with a picture of two
fighting paladins, which he gives up on returning.&nbsp; I
brought away one of these tickets as a ricordo of the
marionettes.&nbsp; The picture is not very clear, because it is
printed from a wood-block that has been a good deal worn.&nbsp;
Mr. Clark has made from it a drawing which looks more like what
the artist originally intended, and I trust that Signor Greco
will not be angry with <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>us for assuming his permission to
reproduce the picture.</p>
<p>In correcting the proof-sheets I have had the assistance of my
sister, Miss Lilian Isabel Jones, and of my friend Mr. R. A.
Streatfeild.&nbsp; I am much obliged to them both for the care
which they have exercised.</p>
<p>I must not conclude without saying that Castellinaria still
remains as in Chapter II of my previous book, &ldquo;not so
marked on any map of Sicily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>September</i>, 1911</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
CHANGES IN THE TOWN</h3>
<p>Enrico Pampalone entered the world with a compliment to his
godfather, for of all the days in the year he chose to be born on
my birthday.&nbsp; Peppino sent me a telegram at once, then a
formal invitation to the christening, then a letter, an extract
from which I translate:</p>
<blockquote><p>With immense joy I inform you that Brancaccia has
given to the light a fine, healthy boy.&nbsp; Mother and child
are well and send you their salutations.&nbsp; We are all beside
ourselves with delight at this happy event and my father is
talking of his grandson all day long.&nbsp; In accordance with
your promise, you ought to hold the baby at the baptism, but, as
I absolutely cannot permit you to undertake so long a journey for
this purpose, I am sending you a formal document and I beg you to
return it to me at once signed with your name in order that the
ceremony may take place with as little delay as possible.</p>
<p>We are all looking forward to the pleasure of seeing you
playing with your godchild which you will be able to do on your
next visit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The formal document was to the following effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>WHEREAS I the undersigned have undertaken the duty
of acting as godfather to Enrico the new-born son of Giuseppe and
Brancaccia Pampalone of the Albergo della Madonna (con giardino)
Castellinaria Sicily AND WHEREAS I am detained in London for
several weeks and desire that the baptism of the said infant
shall not be delayed on that account NOW I DO HEREBY APPOINT
Luigi Pampalone the father of the said Giuseppe Pampalone to be
my substitute for me and in my name to hold the said Enrico
Pampalone his grandson at the sacred font on the occasion of his
baptism <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>and to do all such other acts and
deeds as may be necessary in the promises as fully and
effectually as I could do the same if I were present in my own
person I hereby agreeing to ratify and confirm all that the said
Luigi Pampalone shall do by virtue of this writing AS WITNESS my
hand this day of</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I filled up the date, signed the document, and returned it to
Peppino, and he told me all about the ceremony.&nbsp; By virtue
of the christening I became the padrino of Enrico, who became my
figlioccio, and I also became the compare of Peppino and
Brancaccia and in some spiritual way a member of the
family.&nbsp; Peppino sent me a post-card every week, and so I
learnt that the baby was the finest ever seen, and weighed more
and ate more than any baby that had ever been born in
Castellinaria.&nbsp; Then there came information about the first
tooth and the first intelligent, if unintelligible, sounds.&nbsp;
Soon he was three months old, then six, then a year, and still I
had not seen him.</p>
<p>When at last I returned to Sicily, he was more than a year
old, and came down to the station to meet me.&nbsp; He laughed as
soon as he saw me, threw away his india-rubber ball, and
signified that he was to be given to me.&nbsp; Whatever he wants
is always done at once and, as he never wants anything
unreasonable, the method is working out admirably.&nbsp; I took
him from Brancaccia, and he nestled down in my arms, all the time
gazing up at me with an expression of satisfied wonder, as though
at last he understood something that had been puzzling him.&nbsp;
Peppino was present, but effaced himself by helping Carmelo with
what he calls my &ldquo;luggages.&rdquo;&nbsp; I suppose I
exchanged the usual greetings with the parents, but they did not
count, I had seen them since their marriage; this time I had come
to see Enrico.&nbsp; There was some difficulty about getting into
the carriage, because they thought I could not do it unless they
took him away, and he did not want to be taken away.&nbsp; When
we were settled, and Carmelo was driving us up the zig-zags, I
said:</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t expect me to know much
about babies, not being married or anything&mdash;but isn&rsquo;t
he an unusually fine child for his age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brancaccia was much flattered and replied that recently, when
they had bought him some new clothes, he took the size usually
sold for babies of twice his age.&nbsp; This made Peppino laugh
at his wife, and say that the compare might not know much about
babies, but he knew how to get on the right side of
Ricuzzu&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call him Ricuzzu?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ricuzzu is Enrico in Sicilian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall call him Ricuzzu also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motion of the carriage soon sent the child to sleep.&nbsp;
I handed him back to Brancaccia, and looked at her as she sat
with him in her arms.&nbsp; She was more beautiful than before,
because of something that has eluded the skill of all the
painters who have striven to capture it for their hortus siccus
of the Madonna and Child, something that Enrico had awakened in
her heart, and that I saw glowing in her eyes and throbbing in
all her movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he like Peppino?&rdquo; asked
Brancaccia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the very image of Peppino,&rdquo; I replied; but
I noticed that he also had Brancaccia&rsquo;s blue eyes, and was
promising to have her black hair.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Albergo della Madonna (con giardino) and
Peppino took me up to my room.&nbsp; Brancaccia had been before
us, and had put an enormous bunch of flowers in water on the
table to greet me.&nbsp; I went out on the balcony, just to make
sure that the panorama was still there, and, after putting myself
straight, descended into the garden, where I found Peppino
waiting for me, and where we were to have tea in the English
manner&mdash;&rdquo;sistema Inglese,&rdquo; as Brancaccia
said.</p>
<p>The English system is not always in working order at a
moment&rsquo;s notice, so we had time for a walk round.&nbsp; The
afternoon breeze was conducting a symphony of <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>perfumes,
and, as we strolled among the blossoms that were the orchestra,
we could identify the part played by each flower; sometimes one
became more prominent, sometimes another, but always through the
changing harmonies we could distinguish the stately canto fermo
of the roses, counterpointed with a florid rhythm from the
zagara.&nbsp; If Flaubert had been writing in Sicilian, he could
have said &ldquo;una corona di zagara,&rdquo; or, in English,
&ldquo;a wreath of orange-blossoms,&rdquo; and he need not have
worried himself to death by trying to elude the recurrent
&ldquo;de&rdquo; of &ldquo;une couronne de fleurs
d&rsquo;oranger.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was also music of another
kind coming from a passero solitario (the blue rock thrush) who
was hanging in a cage in a doorway.&nbsp; We spoke to him, and he
could not have made more fuss about us if we had been the King of
Italy and the Pope of Rome paying him a visit.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you pleased with your beautiful
garden, Peppino?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;Yes, and other things too.&nbsp; Sometimes
I am cross with my life; but I think of Brancaccia and the baby,
and I look around me, and then I says to myself, &lsquo;Ah, well,
never mind!&nbsp; Be a good boy!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Presently we came to a fountain which, when I turned a tap,
twisted round and round, spouting out graceful, moving curves,
and the drops fell in the basin below and disturbed the
rose-leaves that were sleeping on the water.&nbsp; I also found
an image of the Madonna and Bambino in a corner, with an
inscription in front promising forty days&rsquo; indulgence to
anyone who should recite devoutly an Ave before it.&nbsp; I
understood this as well as one who is not a Roman Catholic can be
said to understand such a promise, and better than I understood
another image to which Peppino called my attention.&nbsp; It was
a small coloured crockery S. Giuseppe, standing on the top of the
wall and looking into the garden, protected by a couple of tiles
arranged over him as an inverted V, and held in place by dabs of
mortar.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>I said, &ldquo;Why do you keep your patron saint on the
wall like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied that it had nothing to do with him.&nbsp; The land
over the wall belongs to the monks, and they put the saint up to
gaze into the garden in the hope that Peppino&rsquo;s father
might thereby become gradually illuminated with the idea of
giving them a piece of his land; they wanted it to join to their
own, which is rather an awkward shape just there.&nbsp; The
influence of S. Giuseppe had already been at work four years, but
Peppino&rsquo;s father still remained obstinately
unilluminated.</p>
<p>Carmelo brought the tea and set a chair for Ricuzzu, who has
his own private meals like other babies but likes to sit up to
the table and watch his father and mother having theirs,
occasionally honouring their repast by trying his famous
six&mdash;or is it seven?&mdash;teeth upon a crust, which he
throws upon the ground when he has done with it.&nbsp; So we all
four sat together in the shade of the Japanese medlar-tree and
talked about the changes in the town since my last visit.</p>
<p>First Peppino repeated something he had told me last time I
was there, before Ricuzzu was born.&nbsp; It was about the horror
of that fatal night when he heard his father crying in the dark;
he went to his parents&rsquo; room to find out what was the
matter, and heard the old man babbling of being lost on Etna,
wandering naked in the snow.&nbsp; Peppino struck a light, which
woke his father from his dream, but it did not wake his
mother.&nbsp; She had been lying for hours dead by her
husband&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>When the body was laid out and the watchers were praying by it
at night, the widower sat in a chair singing.&nbsp; He was not in
the room with the body, he had his own room, and his song was
unlike anything Peppino had ever heard; it had no words, no
rhythm, no beginning and no end, yet it was not moaning, it was a
cantilena of real notes.&nbsp; It seemed to be a comfort to him
in his grief to pour these lamenting sounds out of his broken
heart.&nbsp; All the town <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>came to the
funeral, for the family is held in much respect, and there were
innumerable letters of condolence and wreaths of flowers.&nbsp;
When it was over, Peppino wrote a paragraph which appeared in the
<i>Corriere di Castellinaria</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A tutte le pie cortesi persone che con assistenza,
con scritti, con l&rsquo;intervento ai funebri della cara
sventurata estinta, con adornarne di fiori l&rsquo;ultima
manifestazione terrena desiderarono renderne meno acre it dolore,
ringraziamenti vivissimi porge la famiglia <span
class="smcap">Pampalone</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He showed me this and waited while I copied it.&nbsp; When I
had finished he went on, talking more to himself than to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life it is not the same when we are wanting someone
to be here that is gone away.&nbsp; When we were young and this
person was living, things it was so; now we can understand this
person who is gone, and things it is other.&nbsp; This is not a
good thing.&nbsp; Now is the time this dear person should be
living; now would we be taking much care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For many weeks they feared lest the father might follow the
mother, but he began to take a new interest in life on the day
when Peppino brought home his bride, and when Ricuzzu was born he
soon became almost his old self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things it is like that,&rdquo; said Peppino; &ldquo;the
young ones are coming to dry the eyes that have tears in them
because the old ones are going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brancaccia&rsquo;s attention was occupied by the tea and the
baby, and by trying to follow Peppino&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp; He has
been giving her English lessons and, though she has not yet got
much beyond saying, &ldquo;Me no speakare l&rsquo;Inglese,&rdquo;
she is quick enough to know what he is talking about, especially
as she has heard most of it before.&nbsp; She now said a few
words in dialect, evidently reminding him of something, and he at
once began to tell me about their wedding tour.&nbsp; He had told
me some of it last time I was there, and how he had wanted to
take his bride to England and show her London, but they had not
time enough, and that journey <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>has been put
off for some future occasion.&nbsp; They went to Venice, which
was a particularly suitable place, because his cousin Vanni was
there with his ship, the <i>Sorella di Ninu</i>, unloading a
cargo of wine; they crossed by night to Naples, and Peppino
showed Brancaccia Pompeii and all the sights; then they went to
Rome for a few days and on, through Florence, to Venice.&nbsp;
They stayed there a week, and then Vanni, having unloaded his
wine, took them down the Adriatic and brought them safely home
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was sun,&rdquo; said Peppino, &ldquo;and we was in
Venice, Sammarco Place, where is&mdash;how speak you the
colomba?&mdash;Excuse me, it is the dove.&nbsp; And there was
different other people also&mdash;love-people, the young ones
that go to the field in the spring to take the flower Margherita,
and to be pulling the leaves to know the future, plenty many;
also sposi, and some that bring the macchina to make the picture,
and the bride was to be standing with the colomba in the
hand.&nbsp; She put the grain in the hand, and would have a
colomba that was with his feet in her finger and eat the grain;
but the bridegroom was not clever to take the photograph and the
colomba was&mdash;what is it?&mdash;he was finish his grain and
flied away, and she was telling to her sposo:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now you are not clever to take the photograph
and you shall be obliged to pay for another packet of
grain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second time, not only a colomba was in the hand
but also another one was stopping in the hat very large with the
colomba, too large, I am not certain that the bridegroom was able
to take all the photograph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Brancaccia interposed, producing the result, and I
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is Brancaccia herself!&nbsp; I did not know you
meant that this happened to you.&nbsp; I thought you were telling
me about other sposi, not about yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they laughed together, and I saw that Brancaccia, by
showing me the photograph, had let out more than was <!-- page
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>intended, unless perhaps it was all intended; either
way, no harm was done, and I was allowed to put the picture in my
pocket.</p>
<p>Carmelo came to clear away the tea, and I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Peppino, that you have a new
waiter.&nbsp; What has become of Letterio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you do not know about Letterio.&nbsp; Now I shall
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point it became necessary for Brancaccia to disappear
somewhat suddenly with the baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was festa,&rdquo; said Peppino, &ldquo;and Letterio
was drinking and his friends were telling to drink some more, and
he was drinking plenty much.&nbsp; Then was he going out in a
very hurry and was telling that he would be married very directly
and was meeting a girl and was telling: &lsquo;Please, you, marry
me this day.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the girl was telling: &lsquo;Go
away, Letterio, you are a drunk man.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he was
finding another girl and they was telling the same
things&mdash;plenty girls&mdash;all that day.&nbsp; Afterwards
many weeks are passing and Letterio don&rsquo;t be asking to be
married, he was telling always that he would not be married
never, never, never; also with the suspicion that no girl would
take him.&nbsp; Excuse me, it is like the man who was fell down
from the horse and was telling that he was go down&mdash;was not
fell down.&nbsp; And it was festa again and Letterio was drinking
plenty much again and was going on the street again and was
meeting a girl again and was telling: &lsquo;Please, you, marry
me very directly.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the girl was replying:
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;surely they were
not so silly as to get married when he was sober, were
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed, however, that they were.&nbsp; To save the expense
and avoid the chaff that would have attended a marriage in
Castellinaria, they went to the next village for a couple of days
and returned married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when the man,&rdquo; said Peppino, &ldquo;must be
finding the courage in the bottle, this is not a good
thing.&nbsp; The <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>courage for the happy marriage must
be in the heart.&nbsp; We know that good wine it is sincero, it
makes to be speaking the truth; yes, very likely.&nbsp; But the
wine it is sometimes traditore, it can also be telling
the&mdash;what is bugia?&nbsp; Excuse me, it is the
lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Letterio is married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, he was married.&nbsp; Now I shall tell
you.&nbsp; Oh! what a bad woman she was!&nbsp; Impossible to keep
her in the albergo.&nbsp; &lsquo;Please go away, Letterio; I am
very sorry; you and your wife also.&rsquo;&nbsp; And went away,
to his home in Messina and his wife also.&nbsp; In the winter was
coming the disaster, the terremoto, the earthquake, and the city
was finished to be consumed and the train was bringing the
fugitives all day and all night.&nbsp; I was down to the station,
Brancaccia was making ready the beds, Carmelo was driving them up
and was bringing more and then more&mdash;broken people, also
whole people, all without nothing, very undressed, and the
albergo was became a hospital, a refugio, and the doctors were
committing operations upon them in the bedrooms and were curing
them and curing them till they died and went away in the
cimitero&mdash;Oh! it was very pitiful&mdash;and sometimes they
were repairing them and sending them away in the train.&nbsp; And
I was making the journey with the hopeness to un-dig
Letterio.&nbsp; During three days was I searching the mournful
ruins of Messina but I don&rsquo;t be finding Letterio, nor alive
nor dead, nor his wife, and I am unhappy; also Brancaccia is
unhappy.&nbsp; This is why she was now going away with
Ricuzzu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I thought probably the baby had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, many times that is the explication, but this time
it is other; it is that she don&rsquo;t like to be hearing the
story of Letterio.&nbsp; I shall tell you that Brancaccia is a
gentle person, very tender in the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;of course she is.&nbsp;
But are not you both making too much of this?&nbsp; You could not
have known there would be an earthquake in Messina.&nbsp; If
there was to <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>be one it might have been in some
other city, and they would not have been destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here; perhaps she was not a so bad woman; perhaps
some day she would be making a little Ricuzzu and would be
learning to be a good woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might learn very slowly or not at all; and think of
her poor husband all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us talk of something other.&nbsp; Do you remember
Alfio Mascaluc&iacute;a?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; what did he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were always calling him Bellini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the barber&rsquo;s shop opposite?&nbsp; Of course, I
remember him, but I had no idea he had such a magnificent name or
I never should have dared to take liberties with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remembered him very well.&nbsp; I remembered going into the
shop one day and he was alone, busy writing at a table in the
corner.&nbsp; He said he was composing a polka.&nbsp; He had
ruled his own staves because, like Schubert, he could not afford
to buy music paper; he wanted all the money he could save to pay
a publisher to publish his polka&mdash;just as we do in
England&mdash;and if it succeeded his fortune would be
made.&nbsp; I felt a sinking at the heart, as though he was
telling me he had been gazing on the mirage of the lottery until
he had dreamt a number.&nbsp; He had filled about two pages and a
half with polka stuff, but had not yet composed the
conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, what I must do is to make it arrive there
where the bars end&rdquo; (he had drawn his bar lines by
anticipation); &ldquo;that will not be difficult; it is the
beginning that is difficult&mdash;the tema.&nbsp; It does not
much matter now what I write for the coda in those empty bars,
but I must fill them all with something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; That, of course&mdash;well, of
course, that is the proper spirit in which to compose a
polka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I had shown myself so intelligent, he often talked to me
about his music and his studies; he had an Italian translation of
Cherubini&rsquo;s <i>Treatise</i>, and had nearly finished <!--
page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>all the exercises down to the end of florid counterpoint
in four parts.&nbsp; His professor was much pleased with him, and
had congratulated him upon possessing a mind full of resource and
originality&mdash;just the sort of mind that is required for
composing music of the highest class.&nbsp; He explained to me
that counterpoint is a microcosm.&nbsp; In life we have destiny
from which there is no escape; in counterpoint we have the canto
fermo of which not a note may be altered.&nbsp; Destiny, like the
canto fermo, is dictated for us by One who is more learned and
more skilful than we; it is for us to accept what is given, and
to compose a counterpoint, many counterpoints, that shall flow
over and under and through, without breaking any of the rules,
until we reach the full close, which is the inevitable end of
both counterpoint and life.</p>
<p>I called him Bellini because he told me that the composer of
<i>Norma</i> had attained to a proficiency in counterpoint which
was miraculous, and that he was the greatest musician the world
had ever known.&nbsp; This high praise was given to Bellini
partly, of course, because he was a native of Catania.&nbsp;
London is a long way from Catania, and in England perhaps we
rather neglect Italian music of the early part of last
century.&nbsp; Once, at Casale-Monferrato, I heard a travelling
company do <i>I Puritani</i>; they did it extremely well, and I
thought the music charming, especially one sparkling little tune
sung by Sir Giorgio to warn Sir Riccardo that if he should see a
couple of fantasmas they would be those of Elvira and Lord
Arturo.&nbsp; Alfio may have been thinking of the maxim,
&ldquo;Ars est celare artem,&rdquo; and may have meant to say
that Bellini had shown himself a more learned contrapuntist than
(say) Bach, by concealing his contrapuntal skill more effectually
than Bach had managed to conceal his in the <i>Mass in B
minor</i>.&nbsp; While my hair was being cut I examined the polka
with interest; it was quite carefully done, the bass was figured
all through and the discords were all resolved in the orthodox
manner; after the shop <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>was shut he came over to the albergo
and played it to us on the piano in the salon.&nbsp; I should say
it was a very good polka, as polkas go, and certainly more in the
manner of the Catanian maestro than in that of the Leipzig
cantor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about Alfio?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
he also marry a bad woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Peppino told me the story of the Figlio di Etna.&nbsp; He
called him this because he came from a village on the slopes of
the volcano, where his parents kept a small inn, the Albergo
Mongibello, and where also lived his cousin Maria, to whom he was
engaged.&nbsp; In the days when he used to talk to me about his
counterpoint, Alfio was about twenty-four, and always so
exceedingly cheerful and full of his music that no one would have
suspected that his private life was being carried on in an
inferno, yet so it was; a widow had fallen in love with him, and
had insisted on his living with her.&nbsp; &ldquo;And look
here,&rdquo; said Peppino, &ldquo;the bad day for Alfio was the
day when he went to the house of the widow.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
too much galantuomo to resist; he had not forgotten Maria but he
thought she could wait, and besides, he was at first flattered by
the widow&rsquo;s attentions and amused by the novelty of the
situation; but he never cared for the widow, and soon his chains
became unbearable.&nbsp; As Peppino said, &ldquo;There
don&rsquo;t be some word to tell the infernalness it is when you
are loved by the woman you hate.&rdquo;&nbsp; He exercised his
contrapuntal ingenuity by devising schemes for circumventing this
troublesome passage in the canto fermo of his life without
breaking any of the rules, and finally hit upon the device of
running away.&nbsp; So many men in a similar difficulty have done
the same thing, that his professor, and even the stern Cherubini
himself, would have condemned the progression less on account of
its harshness and irregularity than because of its lack of
originality.&nbsp; He scraped together about fifty francs and
disappeared to Livorno where he soon found work in a
barber&rsquo;s shop, cutting hair, trimming and shaving beards
and whiskers, <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>and making wigs for the
theatre.&nbsp; He wrote the widow two letters containing nothing
but conventional compliments, and displayed his resource and
originality by posting one in the country and sending the other
to a friend in Genoa who posted it there.</p>
<p>After about three months of freedom, counterpoint and
hair-dressing, he was sent for to return to his village for a few
days and vote; Peppino anticipated my inquiry about the money for
the journey by protesting that he knew nothing about the details
of politics.&nbsp; However it may have been managed, Alfio got
leave from his employer, went home and voted.&nbsp; He said
nothing about the widow, but he promised Maria to return and
marry her in a year, when he should have saved enough
money.&nbsp; He did not know how he was going to do it, but he
had to say something.&nbsp; Then the silly fellow must needs go
for a day to Castellinaria to salute his friends in the
barber&rsquo;s shop there&mdash;just as murderers seem never to
learn that it is injudicious to re-visit the scenes of their
crimes.&nbsp; Naturally the widow heard of his being in the town,
they met in the street and had a terrible row.&nbsp; What
frightened poor Alfio most was a sort of half persuasion that
perhaps he had behaved badly to her.&nbsp; But he did not relent;
he returned to his village, bade farewell to his family, embraced
his adorata mamma, renewed his promise to Maria, went down to
Catania, entered the station and turned pale as he saw the widow
sitting in a corner with a parcel and a bundle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am coming with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had let out that he would return to Livorno in a few days,
and she had resolved to accompany him, wherever he might be
going.&nbsp; She had sold all her furniture in a hurry and come
to Catania, knowing that he must start from there.&nbsp; She
waited for him inside the station when it was open, outside when
it was shut; she had to wait four days and four nights.&nbsp; She
refused to leave him.&nbsp; She bought her own ticket and
travelled with him.&nbsp; They <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>settled down
in Livorno&mdash;if that can be called settling down which was a
continual hurly-burly; the only repose about it appeared in the
bar&rsquo;s rests to which poor Alfio&rsquo;s counterpoint was
now reduced.&nbsp; He grew irritable, abused her and beat her;
but she was one of those women who love their man more
passionately the more he knocks them about.&nbsp; Maria sent him
a post-card for his onomastico, and the widow got hold of
it.&nbsp; This led to his leaving the house for a few nights, but
she had always taken his money for housekeeping, so he had not
enough to leave the town, and she came to the shop in the daytime
and made such a disturbance that he was frightened into
returning.&nbsp; He dreamt of disguising himself in one of his
own theatrical wigs and escaping so, but the idea was too like
some of those contrapuntal combinations which, as Cherubini says,
may be employed in a study-fugue, but which in practical music,
as in practical life, have to be weeded out by artificial
selection.</p>
<p>Then his mother fell ill, and the family sent him the money to
go home to embrace her.&nbsp; The widow had put some of his money
by for an emergency.&nbsp; She was not going to lose sight of him
again, especially now that she knew about Maria; she bought a
ticket and came too.&nbsp; They spent the night at her
brother&rsquo;s house in Catania and Alfio was to go next day to
his village.&nbsp; She said she would come too, he said that
nothing would induce him to take her with him.&nbsp; She implored
and stormed and spat and swore, knowing all the time she could
not appear in his village as belonging to him, and fearing that
he intended to manipulate his going home alone into a way of
escape.&nbsp; She pretended to acquiesce but, in the morning, as
he was passing through the Quattro Canti she was there, disguised
as a man in her brother&rsquo;s clothes, and before Alfio could
recognise her she had stabbed him in the back and he fell down
dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Peppino,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;this is a
worse tragedy than the other.&nbsp; What a horrible
woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&ldquo;The Padre Eterno was very angry that day when he
made the bad woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no satisfaction to poor Alfio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; and not satisfaction to his family.&nbsp; His
mother died of grief during that they were telling her his
murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Maria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maria is telling that she would becoming a
monkey-woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you say in English the lady-priest, the
monaca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&mdash;a nun.&nbsp; But it seems a pity she
should take such a serious step.&nbsp; It is a dreadful story,
Peppino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I am fortunate because I also meet the bad
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Alfio&rsquo;s widow a friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I meet her in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad she did not stab you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the widow&mdash;some other woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is difficult to understand&mdash;difficult to be
sure when it is the bad woman.&nbsp; The bad woman is like
mosquitoes&mdash;not wanted but would not go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was in London, I was at this place where is
the&mdash;please, what is campo?&nbsp; No, not campo, but where
is the beast with the horn in the head&mdash;the
cervo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes, the deer.&nbsp; You mean the Zoological
Gardens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; This place where is the villa with the
red palazzo and the chief labours of painting and beds and
chinesy images are over the place where is coming the fire in the
winter-time, and on the wall is also the armatura and the deer it
is in the trees on the side of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you mean Hampton Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;Yes, and was telling to the lady&mdash;she was a
very kind lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please, what lady?&nbsp; Alfio&rsquo;s widow was
not at Hampton Court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was the wife of the plumber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I am very stupid, Peppino, but I
don&rsquo;t seem to get hold of it.&nbsp; Who is the
plumber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meet him at Margate; also his lady, his wife; they
invite me to their house; I accept their invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Margate is not Hampton Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they inhabit Hampton Court; they go to Margate for
the villeggiatura, for the&mdash;how do you say?&mdash;for the
baths of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now I understand.&nbsp; You met them at Margate and
they invited you to call on them at their house at Hampton
Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, yes.&nbsp; And when I arrive, the husband,
the plumber, he went away with his tools for his work in a sack,
and his lady she says to me, &lsquo;Please sit down.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And we talk together.&nbsp; She was a very kind lady.&nbsp; And
presently&mdash;she was on the sofa by the window and I was in a
chair by the fire&mdash;presently her husband return.&nbsp; I was
like a fish not in his water, but oh! it was my salvation.&nbsp;
Why must he be leaving us together?&nbsp; She was a very kind
lady.&nbsp; And then to be returning without noise, so soon and
so sudden.&nbsp; Do you think&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not know.&nbsp; It looked rather like it, but the
psychology of the Hampton Court plumber resembles the Italian
music of the early part of last century in that it is but little
studied among us.&nbsp; So I congratulated him on his escape, and
inquired whether any of Alfio&rsquo;s compositions had been
published.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alfio don&rsquo;t be writing no
compositions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me he was composing music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alfio never compose something.&nbsp; Too busy.&nbsp;
Look here, the student that shall be always making the exercise
he don&rsquo;t be never composing the music.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>&ldquo;But that polka?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember he
came over to the albergo and played us his polka?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alfio don&rsquo;t write the polka.&nbsp; His professor
gave him the polka to copy for study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see.&nbsp; Well, now don&rsquo;t you think we
have had enough tragedies?&nbsp; Has nothing pleasant happened in
the town since&mdash;?&nbsp; What a stupid question!&nbsp; Here
is Brancaccia bringing the answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brancaccia not only brought the baby, she also brought to show
me the clothes in which he had been christened, just as on my
last visit, before he was born, she had brought and shown me the
clothes in which she had been married.&nbsp; I have a confused
recollection of fine muslin and embroidery and pretty gay
ribbons.&nbsp; I remember more clearly her necklace of Sicilian
amber which has been in the family for generations and, in the
natural order of things, will one day be passed on to the wife of
Ricuzzu.&nbsp; Each piece of amber is circular, flat underneath
and convex above, and is surrounded with a fine golden band
whereby it is joined to the next, side by side.&nbsp; The two
smallest, at the back of the wearer&rsquo;s neck, near the clasp,
are about as big as threepenny bits, and the pieces increase in
size through sixpences, shillings, florins, half-crowns, until
the one in the middle on her breast is nearly as large as a
five-shilling piece.&nbsp; They are all sorts of colours,
honey-yellow, rich orange, Venetian red, brown sherry, some clear
and some clouded, some have insects in them, some when held
properly in the sunlight, have a fluorescent, hazy tinge like the
blue in a horse&rsquo;s eye, some are a peacock-green and others
a deep purple.&nbsp; The largest piece is green, and has objects
in it which Brancaccia says are cherry-blossoms.&nbsp; Peppino
accepts his wife&rsquo;s view because it amuses him to call this
piece The Field of Enna, where Proserpine was gathering flowers
when Pluto carried her off, and these are the flowers she was
gathering.&nbsp; But he knows that this kind of amber is called
Simetite, because it is the fossilised resin of some prehistoric
tree that used to grow <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>on the upper reaches of the river
Simeto which rises at the back of Etna, beyond Bronte, and falls
into the sea near Catania; whereas Castrogiovanni, which is the
modern Enna, is not on the Simeto.&nbsp; Castrogiovanni is,
however, not far from the upper part of another river, which
falls into the Simeto near the sea.&nbsp; And he argues that if
The Field of Enna was washed down the Castrogiovanni river it may
still have exuded from a tree of the same kind as those that used
to grow on the Simeto, and in any case it had to pass through the
mouth of the Simeto before reaching the sea, and so it may be
called Simetite.&nbsp; Having got into the sea, it was thrown up
in a storm or found in a fisherman&rsquo;s net.</p>
<p>Then I must be shown the mule, with his beautiful harness, and
the new cart which Ricuzzu had received as a birthday present
from his grandfather; so we went to the stable.&nbsp; The cart
was painted with the story of Orlando&rsquo;s madness, showing
first how he had gone to bed in his boots; or rather how he lay
outside a bed that was too short for him with all his armour on,
like a lobster on a dish.&nbsp; This occurred in the house of a
contadino who was standing with a lighted candle in his hand and
had brought his wife.&nbsp; They did not know to whom they were
speaking, and were telling him that the room had been occupied
last by a knight and his lady and that the lady, in gratitude for
their hospitality, had given the contadina a bracelet, saying
that she had received it as a present from Orlando.&nbsp; And
Orlando was exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me that bracelet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the second picture the contadina had brought the bracelet,
and Orlando was sitting up, contemplating it and saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the bracelet which I gave to Angelica.&nbsp; The
last occupants of this bed must have been that fatal woman and
her husband Medoro.&nbsp; I am Orlando Paladino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were the two panels on one side of the cart.&nbsp; On
the other side, the third picture showed Orlando, who had <!--
page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>got off the bed, and was standing up delivering a long
&ldquo;Addio&rdquo; in the manner of Othello&mdash;one could
almost hear the words: &ldquo;Orlando&rsquo;s occupation&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; The contadino and his wife were furtively
leaving the room, perhaps because poetry bored these simple folk,
but it may have been because Orlando, having no further use for
his arms, was punctuating his speech by throwing away first la
Durlindana, next his shield, then his helmet, his cuirass, front
and back, his leggings, and his shirt.</p>
<p>In the last picture he had nothing on but a pair of short
white drawers; he had gone quite mad and had knocked down the
house; its fall revealed a smiling landscape across which
peasants and sheep were escaping, and the trees shook with the
violence of his fury.&nbsp; He was catching some of the peasants
and throwing them away, shouting and cursing that fatal woman,
and struggling to drown the music and the drum, which made a
crescendo till the curtain fell.&nbsp; I should have recognised
it even if the pictures had not had titles, because I had
recently seen it in a marionette theatre.</p>
<p>The harness cost as much as the cart, and it took a month to
make it.&nbsp; It was of leather, wood and metal, tasselled with
gold and silver and wool of many colours; here and there were
sparkling bits of looking-glass, and little pictures of ladies;
here and there circles and crescents of blue and red felt, and
little pictures of cupids and angels.&nbsp; Other spaces were
covered with silver tinsel and spangles.&nbsp; There were spread
eagles and horses&rsquo; heads and two bouquets of artificial
flowers.&nbsp; There was a St. George and the Dragon carved in
wood and painted, there were bells and ribbons, and two trophies
of coloured feathers, one for the head and another for the back,
each more magnificent, and three or four times larger, than the
plume which the maresciallo dei carabinieri wears with his gala
uniform.</p>

36</span>CHAPTER II<br />
FESTA RIMANDATA</h3>
<p>One day the bells were ringing for the festa of S. Somebody,
but it was not really his day.&nbsp; Peppino told me that his
proper day had been stormy or unsympathetic or the people had had
some crops to get in or something else to do, and so the saint
had had his festa shifted; or it may have been because some
greater festival had fallen on S. Somebody&rsquo;s day owing to
the mutability of Easter or for some other reason.&nbsp; I had
been wishing I could have been at Castellinaria for the first
anniversary of Ricuzzu&rsquo;s birth, I ought to have wished to
be there for the festa of S. Enrico, but I did not know when it
fell, nor did Peppino; but if festas might be transferred in this
easy way, perhaps we might keep it now and find out afterwards to
what extent it had been shifted.&nbsp; It would have been no use
consulting the baby&mdash;besides, he would have been sure to
agree&mdash;so as they were not very busy in the albergo it was
decided that next day we would keep the onomastico of Ricuzzu and
his padrino by driving down to the shore, throwing stones into
the sea, and perhaps eating a couple of peperoni with a drop of
oil and vinegar and a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>Next morning the mule, the cart and the harness were brought
out; it was the first time they had all been used together, and
when Peppino and Carmelo had harnessed the little beast, he
trotted up and down in the sunshine as proud as though he had
been clothed in a rainbow and freshened up with dewdrops.</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Do you keep the onomastico of the mule
also?&nbsp; It seems to me that he is as much pleased with
himself as anyone.&nbsp; He looks as though he thought everything
belonged to him.&nbsp; What is his name and when is his
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;We call him Guido Santo,&rdquo; replied
Peppino.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will make it his festa also and
afterwards we shall be discovering his day in the
calendario.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if it comes to that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;why
shouldn&rsquo;t we include you and Brancaccia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; shouted Peppino, &ldquo;and Carmelo
also.&nbsp; Festa rimandata per tutti!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chair for Brancaccia and the baby was tied in the cart among
a multitude of parcels and baskets about which I thought it
better not to inquire.&nbsp; Peppino and I sat on the floor in
front, like the driver and his mate on an illustrated post-card,
with our feet dangling down between the shafts among the
mule&rsquo;s hind legs.&nbsp; Carmelo started us off and got in
behind, and we drove to the sea, not the way to the station and
the port, but by the road that descends on the other side of the
headland.&nbsp; We passed by groves of lemon, star-scattered with
fruit and blossom and enclosed in rough walls of black lava; by
the grey-green straggling of the prickly pears and by vines
climbing up their canes.&nbsp; We caught glimpses of promontories
dotted with pink and white cottages and of the thread of foam
that outlines the curve of the bay where a train was busily
puffing along by the stony, brown beach, showing how much a
little movement will tell in a still landscape.&nbsp; Behind the
shimmering olives, first on one side, then on the other as we
turned with the zig-zags of the dusty road, was the purple blue
of the sea flecked with the white sails of fishing-boats and with
the crests of whiter waves.&nbsp; Every one we met looked at us
and admired the splendour of the cart and the sparkling newness
of the harness until they caught sight of Brancaccia and the
baby, and then they saw nothing but their beauty.&nbsp; We met
the man who was riding up from the fishing village with baskets
of fish for the town because it was Friday.&nbsp; Peppino and
Carmelo disputed as to the amount he was carrying, and agreed at
last that it must be about a hundred kilogrammes, partly by the
quantity and partly because it had been <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>good weather
for fishing; when it is bad he cannot bring more than thirty,
forty or fifty.</p>
<p>Peppino told me that our mule was the offspring of an ass and
a mare.&nbsp; These, he says, are better than those born of a
horse and a she-ass.&nbsp; Mules can be male or female, and Guido
Santo was a male but, except for the fact that the males are
stronger than the females, the sex of a creature that is
incapable of reproducing itself is not a very interesting
subject.&nbsp; Our mule was still young, and had not yet learnt
the use of corners, nor how to pass things in the road.&nbsp;
Carmelo often had to get down and continue his education.&nbsp;
After one of these lessons he lighted his pipe with a sulphur
match which tainted the morning air and offended Ricuzzu; but
almost immediately we came to a forge and the blacksmith was
striking a piece of iron on his anvil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ricuzzu bello,&rdquo; said Brancaccia, &ldquo;listen to
the pretty music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ricuzzu listened and laughed; the pleasant acid flavour of
the note as it followed us corrected the sulphur, and he put up
his face for a kiss.&nbsp; Brancaccia knew how to smooth away his
troubles and how to deserve his thanks.</p>
<p>We passed a boy singing, and I said how pleasant it was to
hear a real Sicilian melody sung by a modern Theocritus about the
delights of his own country.&nbsp; But Peppino soon put a stop to
that.&nbsp; The boy was one of a theatrical company that had
arrived in the town from Piedmont where the song was popular; he
did not know all the words, but it contained these:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mamma mia, dammi cento lire<br />
Ch&egrave; in America voglio andar.<br />
Mother darling, give me a hundred lire<br />
For I want to be off to the States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Are they acting here?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are reciting <i>Il Diavolo Verde</i>.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t will go and see this evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;If Brancaccia is not too tired, let us finish up
Ricuzzu&rsquo;s festa by a visit to the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baby was wide awake all the time, observing everything,
and much interested.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe Ricuzzu understands that we are keeping his
onomastico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, yes,&rdquo; replied Peppino; &ldquo;Ricuzzu
very intelligent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he even understands that it is not S.
Enrico&rsquo;s day, and appreciates the idea of keeping his festa
when it is convenient for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, yes; the idea is the thing.&nbsp; Always it
is the idea.&nbsp; Did you know the idea of the girl who went to
confess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now.&nbsp; Please expect.&nbsp; I am too much busy
with Guido Santo.&nbsp; Please, when we shall be
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On arriving at the shore we first found a cove where
Brancaccia and Ricuzzu could be comfortable while Peppino,
Carmelo and I went a little way off into a secluded place behind
the rocks, undressed and bathed.&nbsp; We swam round and saluted
the mother and child in their cove, but could not get near enough
to splash them because the water was only a few inches deep near
the shore and the proprieties had to be observed.&nbsp; When we
were tired of swimming we came out and dressed.&nbsp; Then I took
the baby while Peppino and Brancaccia went round into our
dressing-room and he superintended her bath.&nbsp; Carmelo, in
the meantime constructed a fireplace among the rocks and got his
cooking things and all the parcels and baskets out of the
cart.&nbsp; Peppino and Brancaccia returned, and we found a
shallow, shady pool with a sandy bottom, undressed Ricuzzu, and
put him into it.&nbsp; I observed that the baby&rsquo;s clothes
were reefed with safety pins, but I said nothing about it,
thinking the reefs could be let out when he had attained twice
the age he was when they were bought.&nbsp; The proprieties did
not matter with this bather, who <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>soon learnt
how to splash us.&nbsp; It may have been his padrino&rsquo;s
vanity, but I thought he laughed loudest when he succeeded in
splashing me.</p>
<p>The couple of peperoni had swelled into a regular
colazione.&nbsp; First, of course, we had pasta, this time it was
called lingue di passeri (sparrows&rsquo; tongues), they have
fifty different names for it according to its size and shape, but
it is always pasta.&nbsp; Carmelo made a sauce for it over his
fire with oil, onions, extract of tomatoes, and certain herbs;
the recipe is a secret which is to be imparted to Ricuzzu when he
is fifteen, but I think Brancaccia has already guessed it, though
she is not supposed to know.&nbsp; As a rule, I try to get only
half as much pasta as a Sicilian takes, and of that I can only
eat half, but on this occasion, either because of Carmelo&rsquo;s
cooking or the sea breeze, or the presence of Ricuzzu, I ate it
all, and it made me feel like Rinaldo after the terrible fight in
which he kills the centaur and stands at the wings panting for
breath.</p>
<p>The pasta was followed by bacon and figs&mdash;an unexpectedly
delicious combination; the bacon is uncooked and cut very thin,
the figs are fresh and ripe, but it would not do in England
because, although one could probably find the bacon in Soho, our
figs never attain to Sicilian ripeness.&nbsp; Carmelo then
surpassed himself with a pollo alla cacciatora, after which we
had a mixed fry of all sorts of fish.&nbsp; Peaches out of the
garden and cheese followed.&nbsp; Also we drank Peppino&rsquo;s
own wine made from the grapes he had planted with his own hands
and trodden with his own feet, and there was coffee with the
cigarettes.</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;I did not know Carmelo was a cook, I thought he
was a coachman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also is he a cook.&nbsp; Also the nurse of
Ricuzzu.&nbsp; Also a waiter.&nbsp; Very good boy Carmelo.&nbsp;
We took him when Letterio went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Brancaccia is not afraid to have him as
Ricuzzu&rsquo;s nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>&ldquo;Because he has been in prison for stabbing his
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, in prison.&nbsp; But his friend was a bad man,
was taking away Carmelo&rsquo;s girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the friend marry Carmelo&rsquo;s girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Carmelo got another girl.&nbsp; Plenty girls
very fond of Carmelo.&nbsp; Look here, the girls always are
liking the boy that has been in prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; well, of course, one can understand that.&nbsp; By
the by, what was that about the girl who went to
confess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know what is confess?&nbsp; All right, I shall
tell you.&nbsp; The box is inside for the priest behind the
railings, and the other place that is open is for the man or the
woman that have sinned.&nbsp; And the girl is coming and is
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My father, I have sinned.&nbsp; I had the idea
to rob my sister of a hen, but I would not do it.&nbsp; What is
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The father was telling, &lsquo;It is a very bad
idea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the girl was repeating that she don&rsquo;t be
doing the wickedness, only the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; was telling the father,
&lsquo;it is the idea that is the thing, and you would be fined
with five francs to the church to make the Messa and the church
would give the Messa for the sin and the sin would be delivered
after the Messa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl takes from her pocket the five francs and put
to the railings.&nbsp; The father is telling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is not possible to touch.&nbsp; Please give
me from the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl was answering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind; you have the idea to take the money
and it is the idea that is the thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you understand?&nbsp; All right, please take to
eat.&nbsp; Some more fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please take some more pollo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Peppino, I have eaten too much
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please take to the drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>&ldquo;I have had quite enough, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some more wine?&nbsp; Do not think about
Letterio.&nbsp; You shall not be meeting your dolce
cuore&mdash;your sweetheart, this day.&nbsp; You have not yet
taken one glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I have drunk quite as much as is good for
me&mdash;much more than a glass&mdash;nearly a bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good till you shall drink the three glasses of
Noah.&nbsp; Did you know what is the glass of Noah?&nbsp; All
right, I shall tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told me about Noah and the Devil.</p>
<p>The patriarch Noah was working in his field one day when the
Devil came along, put his arms on top of the gate, and looking
over, said in a friendly way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Noah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Devil,&rdquo; replied Noah.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let me interrupt; you seem busy this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Noah; &ldquo;I am planting the
vine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said the Devil, &ldquo;but this is rather
interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he slipped inside the field and took a seat on a large
white stone.&nbsp; Noah went on with his work.</p>
<p>A lion was prowling round and came through the gate which the
Devil had carelessly left open.&nbsp; The Devil killed the lion
and watered the vine with its blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Noah
testily.</p>
<p>The Devil paid no attention.&nbsp; A monkey dropped down from
a tree and came skipping up to them to see what was going
on.&nbsp; The Devil killed the monkey and watered the vine with
its blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you leave the poor beasts alone?&rdquo;
said Noah, who had always deprecated cruelty to animals, and was
beginning to lose his temper.</p>
<p>The Devil paid no attention.&nbsp; A pig was wallowing in the
mud close by&mdash;there had been a good deal of rain
lately.&nbsp; The Devil killed the pig and watered the vine with
its blood.</p>
<p>This was too much for Noah.&nbsp; He shouted:
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>you got any work of your own to do,
you lazy devil?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was so angry he forgot to say
&ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better go home; your
dinner will be getting cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hot&rsquo; you mean,&rdquo; replied the Devil,
looking for his hat, which had fallen behind the large white
stone.&nbsp; &ldquo;What an ungrateful husbandman you are!&nbsp;
I have been helping you to make your wine.&nbsp; When you have
drunk the first glass, you will feel strong and behave
furiously.&nbsp; When you have drunk the second glass, you will
forget how to think for yourself, you will imitate other people
and behave foolishly.&nbsp; When you have drunk the third
glass&mdash;Need I continue?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; Good
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the Devil put his hands into his pockets, tucked his
tail up under his left arm and swaggered away, thinking of his
next job and whistling &ldquo;La Donna &egrave;
Mobile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the glass of Noah,&rdquo; said Peppino in
conclusion, &ldquo;was containing one bottle.&nbsp; Did you
understand?&nbsp; All right; I give you a medal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it will be a real medal and not like the idea of
the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see.&nbsp; Please take to drink the milk of
Ricuzzu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baby had had one bottle of milk, but there was another
ready for him.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Peppino, I could not eat or drink another
mouthful of anything.&nbsp; I could not even eat a slice of
Ricuzzu himself; besides, I don&rsquo;t believe Carmelo knows how
to cook babies&mdash;not so as to make them really
tasty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brancaccia understood enough to know we were talking about
Ricuzzu.&nbsp; She left off clearing away, and snatched the baby
out of Carmelo&rsquo;s arms, whispering to me: &ldquo;I know it
is all right, but I shall feel safer if I have him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peppino, who was lying on his back, observed her agitation out
of the corner of his eye and said to me, maliciously speaking
Italian so that she should understand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would like to eat the baby, please say whether
<!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>Carmelo shall boil him or cut him up and stew him alla
cacciatora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no.&nbsp; I prefer Ricuzzu alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a bad papa,&rdquo; said Brancaccia, &ldquo;and
the compare is a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she gave me the baby as a reward and slapped her
husband&rsquo;s cheek as a punishment.&nbsp; Peppino naturally
retaliated, and in a moment they were rolling over and over and
bear-fighting like a couple of kittens at play, while Carmelo and
I sat and laughed at them, and the baby crowed and clapped his
hands and grew so excited I could scarcely hold him.</p>
<p>There came a pause and Peppino said: &ldquo;My dear, if you
will leave off boxing my ears I will tell you a
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brancaccia instantly desisted and went and sat apart to
recover herself.</p>
<p>Peppino continued: &ldquo;I knew the compare would refuse to
eat the baby.&nbsp; He does not like our Sicilian dishes.&nbsp;
Every time he comes to see us it is a penitenza for him, because
he cannot eat food grown in our island.&nbsp; But I know what I
shall do.&nbsp; I shall send a telegram to London: &lsquo;English
gentleman starving in Castellinaria.&nbsp; Please send at once
one chop, one bottle of stout.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he continued, suddenly sitting up and
becoming serious.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the clime.&nbsp; Here is the
country not adapted to the beast, few rain, few grass, few beefs,
few muttons, and all too thin and the land is good only for the
goats and we must be eating such things that are doing bad to the
stomaco&mdash;the little chickens and the poor fishes and the
pasta&mdash;not other.&nbsp; In England shall be falling always
the rain and plenty grass shall be growing and the beefs and the
muttons shall be fat and much nourishment shall come to those who
are eating them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that if I could have chops and stout instead of the few
odds and ends which Carmelo had managed to scrape together for
our ridiculously inadequate luncheon, <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>of course I
should stay at Castellinaria and never go home any more.</p>
<p>So that was settled for the time, and Brancaccia, having put
herself tidy, proposed a visit to the grottoes.&nbsp; Carmelo
packed up his kitchen and took it off to the cart.&nbsp; On the
way he met his cousin, borrowed his boat and came rowing in
it&mdash;for Carmelo is also a fisherman.&nbsp; We got in and
rowed round the promontory and into the caves.&nbsp; The baby was
a good deal puzzled, he thought he was indoors, and yet it
wasn&rsquo;t right, but he was pleased.&nbsp; When we were tired
of the grottoes we rowed back, restored the boat to
Carmelo&rsquo;s cousin, packed ourselves into the cart and Guido
Santo took us up the zig-zags to Castellinaria after a day which
we all enjoyed very much; Ricuzzu, who understood least, perhaps
enjoyed it most, but then this baby enjoys everything.&nbsp; If
we could have remanded his festa for a few years, instead of only
a few days or weeks or whatever it was, he might have understood
more and enjoyed less.</p>
<p>Ricuzzu did not come to the theatre, he was supposed to be
tired, so Brancaccia put him to bed and, leaving him with
Carmelo, accompanied Peppino and me to see <i>Il Diavolo
Verde</i>.&nbsp; We took our seats while the fianc&eacute;e of
Don Giuseppe, assisted by her lady&rsquo;s-maid, was endeavouring
to make up her mind.&nbsp; The difficulty was that Don Giovanni,
the brother of Giuseppe, had sent her a case of jewels and, like
Margherita, in <i>Faust</i>, she could not resist the temptation
to try them on in front of a looking-glass.&nbsp; We saw in the
glass the reflection of a devil in green with pink
trimmings.&nbsp; He appeared to be standing behind her, looking
over her shoulder, but he was not really present; it must have
been a magic mirror.&nbsp; Don Giovanni came and denounced his
brother who, he said, was a bastard and no gentleman, proving his
words by the production of their father&rsquo;s will written on a
sheet of brown paper which he always carried in his belt.&nbsp;
This convinced the lady, and she went off with Giovanni.&nbsp;
Don Giuseppe, <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>who had been carried away by armed
men, escaped and returned to meditate on the crisis of his
life.&nbsp; Remembering that the green devil was a retainer of
his family, he summoned him and laid the case before him.&nbsp;
This time the devil really came and told Giuseppe that there was
a way out of his trouble, but that it would involve (1) the
perdition of two souls, (2) the shedding of blood, (3) sacrilege,
(4) perjury, and (5) all his courage.&nbsp; Don Giuseppe agreed
and the curtain fell.</p>
<p>The next act was in the cemetery in front of the tomb of the
father of the two brothers.&nbsp; Don Giuseppe and the green
devil came in, carrying another will, engrossed on brown paper,
but not executed, a bottle of ink, and a quill pen.&nbsp; They
stood in front of the door of the tomb and spoke some
sacrilegious words.&nbsp; The door opened and revealed the corpse
of the father like a Padre Eterno, standing upright, clothed in
white, with a white face, a flowing white beard and white kid
gloves.&nbsp; Brancaccia was, I believe, really as much
frightened as Don Giuseppe pretended to be and I did not like
it.&nbsp; The green devil encouraged his master to approach the
corpse, which he did, first dipping the pen in the
ink-bottle.&nbsp; He offered the pen and held in a convenient
manner the new will which would put everything straight, begging
his father to sign it.&nbsp; The corpse slowly raised its stiff
right arm, took the pen in its hand and signed the will; it then
dropped the pen on the ground, lowered its stiff right arm and
the door of the tomb closed.&nbsp; Except for this, it did not
move and it did not speak at all.&nbsp; It was a ghastly scene
and the house was as still as though it had been empty.</p>
<p>In the next act we returned to Don Giovanni whom we found
playing dice with Fernando at an inn.&nbsp; When Fernando had
lost his money and his jewellery and his lands and his castle and
his furniture, he played for his wife, and Don Giovanni won her
also.&nbsp; Whereupon Fernando wrote two letters to his wife,
one, which they sent by a messenger, told her to come to the inn
at once, the <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>other was for Don Giovanni to give to
her when she came.&nbsp; Fernando then went away, leaving the
coast clear, and the lady entered.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Don Giovanni</span>: Donna Inez, I love
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Donna Inez</span>: Silence, Sir.&nbsp; I
am here to meet my husband.&nbsp; Where is he?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Don G</span> (<i>giving her the second
letter</i>): He left this for you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Donna I</span> (<i>reads</i>): &ldquo;Dear
Inez: We have been playing dice.&nbsp; Don Giovanni has
won.&nbsp; You now belong to him.&nbsp; Your affectionate
husband, Fernando.&rdquo;&nbsp; It cannot be!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
false!&nbsp; My husband would never behave in so ungentlemanly a
manner.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giov</span>: On the contrary,
Madama.&nbsp; And is not this his handwriting?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span>: Now that I look at it again, it

<p><span class="smcap">In</span>: There is, however, one little
difficulty about which, of course, you could have known

swore I would be true to my husband during his life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
MARIONETTISTS AT HOME</h3>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Alessandro Greco to the Author</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap">Marionette Theatre</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Piazza Nuova</span>, <span
class="smcap">Palermo</span>,<br />
4 <i>June</i>, 1909.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Enrico</span>,</p>
<p>Since I last wrote to you there has been a continual to-do and
no time for writing letters.&nbsp; What has been the to-do?&nbsp;
Is it possible you have forgotten my telling you that I am
studying to be a singer and that I take lessons every day?&nbsp;
Now listen to this: Here in Palermo, a new opera was performed
recently for the benefit of the victims of the earthquake at
Messina.&nbsp; The story was taken from a great German romance
and the music was composed by an Italian who is now in
America.&nbsp; I was asked to sing as a supplementary
tenor.&nbsp; We had a month of rehearsals and in the end the
performance was splendidly successful.&nbsp; O my dear
friend!&nbsp; If you had seen me on the stage!&nbsp; I was
dressed as a warrior with a wig of curly hair and a pair of
moustaches.&nbsp; I also received applause, and, when I appeared
before the audience to bow my acknowledgments, I thought:
&ldquo;Oh, if only my dear friend were present, how he would be
applauding me!&rdquo;&nbsp; You will understand after that
whether I have had any time to write to you; but now that things
have calmed down a little and there is less going on I can write
to you as much as you like.</p>
<p>As you know, I am always busy in the teatrino; the other
evening we repeated Samson, that play which you once saw
here.&nbsp; If you will believe me, I was thinking of you the
whole time because I remembered that when we gave it two years
ago you were present.</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>Just now in the <i>Story of the Paladins</i>, Orlando is
throwing away his arms and running about naked in the woods, mad
for love of Angelica; and soon we shall have the burning of
Bizerta and the destruction of the Africans.&nbsp; This will
finish in July and we shall then begin the <i>Story of Guido
Santo</i>.</p>
<p>What have you done with that photograph of myself which I gave
you and which you put into your cigarette-case?&nbsp; Is still
there, or have you lost it?&nbsp; I have often promised to send
you another but have not done so because when you come to Palermo
in September I hope we shall be photographed together, you and
I.&nbsp; Nevertheless I send you this one now, it was taken by an
English lady who came to the teatrino last summer; you see me
getting into a rage with a paladin, I am talking seriously to him
and swearing at him because he will not let me dress him
properly.</p>
<p>I will not prolong this letter, I do not wish to bore you; but
I promise you that I will never fail to let you know of my doings
and I count on you to tell me of yours.</p>
<p>Costantino, Sansone, Rinaldo, Rosina, Angelica, Ferra&ugrave;,
Pasquino, Onofrio and all the other marionettes embrace you and
send you their kind regards.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am and always shall be<br />
Your affectionate friend<br />
<span class="smcap">Alessandro Greco</span> (Buffo).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On arriving at Palermo, I went to the teatrino at about ten at
night; not seeing the buffo in his usual place keeping order at
the door, I guessed he must be on the stage and, knowing the way,
passed through the audience, dived under the proscenium, crept
along a short passage, mounted a ladder and appeared among them
unannounced.&nbsp; The father, the buffo and his brother, Gildo,
were so much astonished that they dropped their marionettes all
over the stage and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you come?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did you not
write?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did you not telegraph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereby spreading their astonishment among the audience, who
saw no connection between these ejaculations and the exploits of
Guido Santo.&nbsp; They soon <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>recovered
themselves, however, picked up their paladins and managed to
bring the performance to its conclusion, and we shut the theatre
and proceeded upstairs to the house.&nbsp; On the way the buffo
took me aside into his workshop to show me two inflammable
Turkish pavilions which he was making; Ettorina in her madness
was to fire them in a few days, one in the afternoon and the
other at the evening repetition, as a conclusion to the
spectacle.&nbsp; I inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was Ettorina, and why did she go mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you presently,&rdquo; replied the buffo,
&ldquo;we must first go upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we went up I asked after the singing and he promised to
take me to the house of his professor to hear him have a
lesson.&nbsp; Papa and Gildo had preceded us and we found them
with the young ladies, Carolina and Carmela, and the child, Nina,
who is as much a buffa as her brother Alessandro is a
buffo.&nbsp; In a moment, the air was thick with compliments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Papa</span>: And how well you are
looking!&nbsp; So much fatter than last year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span> (<i>accepting the
compliment</i>): That is very kind of you.&nbsp; You are all
looking very well also.&nbsp; Let me see, Buffo mio, how old are
you now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alessandro</span>: Guess.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Twenty-five.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aless</span>: Bravo.&nbsp; I completed my
twenty-fifth year just three weeks ago.&nbsp; And you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: I have also completed my
twenty-fifth year, but I did it more than three weeks ago.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aless</span>: I see.&nbsp; You have
twenty-five years on one shoulder; and how many more on the
other?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Twenty-five.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aless</span>: It seems to me you are
making a habit of attaining twenty-five.&nbsp; Are you going to
do it again?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: I have begun, but I shall
put off completing it as long as possible.&nbsp; If you want to
know my exact age <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>I will give you the materials for
making the calculation.&nbsp; I went to the Great Exhibition of
1851.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: Tell us about it.&nbsp; I
have often seen pictures of it in the illustrated papers, but I
have never spoken to anyone who was there.&nbsp; Was it very
beautiful?&nbsp; Were there many people?&nbsp; Did you see Queen
Victoria?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: I can&rsquo;t tell you much
about it.&nbsp; I was asleep and when I woke up I was so hungry
that I cried till my mother took me into a side room and gave me
my dinner.&nbsp; Then I went to sleep again until they took me
home.&nbsp; I have been to many exhibitions since, but I never
enjoyed one so much.&nbsp; You see, this one did not bore me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aless</span>: You should not have had your
dinner there.&nbsp; I went to the exhibition in Palermo and the
food in the restaurant was not wholesome.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: Yes, but you must remember
that Alessandro is very particular about his food.&nbsp; He can
only eat the most delicate things and must have plenty of
variety.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: I did not have much variety
in those days.&nbsp; I took my restaurant with me, the one at
which I was having all my meals.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: Oh well, if one can afford
to travel like a prince&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Gildo!&nbsp; I was not six
weeks old and&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Papa</span>: I have now made the
calculation and I find you are my senior by six years.&nbsp; I
hope that when I have caught you up I shall carry my age as
lightly as you carry yours.&nbsp; Do I explain myself?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aless</span> (<i>to me</i>): I think you
look older.&nbsp; I should have said you were a well-preserved
man of sixty-four or (<i>stretching a point in my favour</i>)
perhaps sixty-five.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span> (<i>feeling sure that here
must be another compliment</i>): Thank you very much.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Buffo</span>: Not at all; it does you
great credit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: Now me, please.&nbsp; Ask me
my age.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Well, Gildo, and how old
are you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: A hundred and seventy-four
next birthday.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Santo Diavolo!&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t look it.&nbsp; You must have been very busy since
last autumn when, if I remember right, you were only
twenty-one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Carolina</span> (<i>tapping my right arm
to attract my attention</i>): Signor Enrico, Signor Enrico, why
do you not ask me my age?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Carmela</span> (<i>tapping my left
arm</i>): Signor Enrico, Signor Enrico, you have not asked me my
age.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Because I know how old you
are.&nbsp; You are both of you the age that charming young ladies
always are, and you do not look a day older.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nina</span>: I&rsquo;m fourteen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Caro</span> and <span
class="smcap">Carm</span> (<i>comparing notes</i>): Did you hear
what he said?&nbsp; He said we are charming young ladies.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nina</span> (<i>insisting</i>): I&rsquo;m
fourteen.&nbsp; Do I look it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: I can compliment you on
looking a little older.&nbsp; Since last year you have grown out
of being a child, but you have hardly yet grown into being a
young lady like your sisters, though you are quite as
charming.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aless</span> (<i>taking the opportunity to
begin</i>): First you must know that Carlo Magno is now dead and
the Pope is shut up in Paris and is being&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Caro</span>: Signor Enrico, Signor Enrico,
do you drink marsala in London?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Marsala is known in London,
but we do not drink it every day as you do in Palermo.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: In England people drink tea;
everything is so different in England.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: That is quite true,
Gildo.&nbsp; In England what is like that (<i>holding my hand out
with the palm up</i>) in Sicily is like this (<i>holding it with
the palm down</i>:<i> Peppino Pampalone taught me this
gesture</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: And that is why in London
the people walk on their feet, whereas in Palermo they walk on
their hands, as you have no doubt observed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aless</span>: Si; e ecco perch&egrave; in
Londra si mangia colla bocca, ma qu&igrave;, in Palermo, si
mangia nella maniera che ti <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>far&ograve;
vedere da un diavolo nel teatrino.&nbsp; But I was telling you
about the Pope.&nbsp; He is shut up in Paris, where he is
guarding the Christians against the&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Caro</span>: Signor Enrico, do you ever
see the sun in London?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: Yes, they see the sun in
London, but only on three days of the week; on the other days
they send it to be cleaned.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Carm</span>: Then it is not the same sun
as ours?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: It is a different sun.&nbsp;
Our sun is made of gold and remains always bright.&nbsp; The sun
of London is made of copper and, being constantly exposed to the
air, it tarnishes more rapidly even than the breastplate of Carlo
Magno, and you know what a lot of cleaning that wants.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Papa</span>: All this is very interesting,
but listen to me.&nbsp; I have something to say.&nbsp; When I was
a boy at school&mdash;are you attending?&nbsp; Very well, then, I
may proceed.&nbsp; When I was a boy at school, we had a professor
who told us that in consequence of&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Caro</span>: Signor Enrico, Signor Enrico,
what is the English for Grazie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: It means Thank you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Carm</span>: Signor Enrico, Signor Enrico,
what is the English for Buona notte?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Buona notte in English is
Good night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aless</span>:&mdash;and Paris is being
besieged by four Turkish emperors, namely, Rodoferro di Siberia,
Balestrazzo di Turgovia, Leofine di Cina and Bracilone
d&rsquo;Africa, and they have two hundred thousand men&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: Now me, please.&nbsp; Teach
me to speak English.&nbsp; What did you say is the English for
Grazie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Thank you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span>: And Buona notte?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Good night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gildo</span> (<i>tentatively</i>): Thank
you.&nbsp; Good night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Bravo, very good.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Caro</span>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Myself</span>: Very good means&mdash;</p>

seventy-four.&nbsp; Do I explain myself?</p>

<p>I took leave of the young ladies, and Papa, Alessandro and
Gildo accompanied me to the albergo, where they left me.&nbsp; As
I approached my bedroom door I looked up over it half-expecting
to see there the words which, years ago, I had seen written over
the entrance to a Tuscan monastery:</p>
<blockquote><p>O beata Solitudo!<br />
O sola Beatitudo!</p>

<h3><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
MALAGIGI</h3>
<p>Next morning I called on the buffo in his workshop.&nbsp; His
two combustible Turkish pavilions were finished, ready to be
fired by Ettorina, and he was full of his devils.&nbsp; I
inquired why we were doing Guido Santo so soon; it was only a
year since my last visit to Palermo, when I had witnessed his
lamented end after a fortnight of starvation in prison, and, at
this rate, the story would be over in fourteen months instead of
lasting eighteen.&nbsp; The buffo said they had made the
experiment of shortening it.&nbsp; If one has to shorten a story,
probably the <i>Paladins of France</i> with its continuations
would suffer less from the process than many others.&nbsp; At all
events it could scarcely grow longer, as a work of art so often
does when one tries to shorten it.</p>
<p>The devils were naturally among the dramatis person&aelig; of
the teatrino, but they had to be got ready and repaired and
provided with all things necessary for them to make the
subterranean road.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that I quite followed all you told me
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was perhaps a little confusion?&rdquo; he
inquired apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I replied politely; &ldquo;but I
never heard of Argantino before.&nbsp; Did you say he was the son
of Malagigi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right.&nbsp; He did not happen to be at
Roncisvalle, so he was not killed with Orlando and the other
paladins.&nbsp; An angel came to him and said, &lsquo;Now the
Turks will make much war against the Christians and, since the
Christians always want a magician, it is the will of heaven that
you shall have the rod of Malagigi, who is no longer here, and
that Guido Santo shall have la Durlindana, the sword of <!-- page
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>Orlando.&rsquo;&nbsp; And it was so, and Argantino
thereafter appeared as a pilgrim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember about Malagigi; he made all Rinaldo&rsquo;s
armour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, he made some of his armour; but he did not
make his helmet, nor his sword Fusberta, nor his horse
Baiardo.&nbsp; First you must know that Rinaldo was one of the
four brothers, sons of Amone, and their sister was
Bradamante.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her die at Trapani.&nbsp; The Empress Marfisa
came and found her dying of grief in a grotto for the loss of her
husband, Ruggiero da Risa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; She was Marfisa&rsquo;s sister-in-law
because she married Marfisa&rsquo;s brother Ruggiero da
Risa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who was the cavaliere errante, Ruggiero
Persiano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the son of Marfisa and Guidon Selvaggio, and
this Guidon Selvaggio was the son of Rinaldo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had Bradamante no children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guido Santo is the son of Bradamante and Ruggiero da
Risa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard something about Guido Santo at Castellinaria
the other day&mdash;let me see, what was it?&nbsp; Never
mind.&nbsp; I hope he left children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you last year that he never married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, of course; that is what I was thinking
of.&nbsp; One cannot remember everything at once and pedigrees
are always confusing at first.&nbsp; Then it is for love of
Bradamante&rsquo;s nephew by marriage, Ruggiero Persiano, that
Ettorina has now gone mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo.&nbsp; And Malagigi was Bradamante&rsquo;s
cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amone had a brother Buovo, and Malagigi was the son of
Buovo.&nbsp; Therefore Malagigi was the cousin of Rinaldo and of
Bradamante.&nbsp; And that is all you need know about the
pedigree for the present.&nbsp; Malagigi was Emperor of
Magic.&nbsp; Other magicians only commanded a devil or two <!--
page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>each, but Malagigi dominated all the hosts of the
inferno, all the devils, harpies, serpents, gorgons, hydras,
furies and also the monster Briareus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as the buffo dominates all the marionettes in the
teatrino,&rdquo; I interpolated.</p>
<p>He bowed and proceeded: &ldquo;Rinaldo&rsquo;s helmet used to
belong to Mambrino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read about it in <i>Don Quixote</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but that was not a real helmet; that was only a
barber&rsquo;s basin because Cervantes wanted to laugh at Don
Quixote.&nbsp; Rinaldo slew Mambrino and took his helmet, but
Mambrino was a giant and his helmet was too large for Rinaldo, so
Malagigi took it down into the laboratory of the inferno and
altered it to fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do the audience see all that done on the
stage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of it; and what they do not see they
imagine.&nbsp; Fusberta, Rinaldo&rsquo;s sword, formerly belonged
to another giant, Atlante.&nbsp; Malagigi always intended it for
Rinaldo, but he was a wise magician and knew that people do not
value things unless they pay for them, so he would not let him
have it till he had earned it by killing Atlante.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather like what you told me last year about
Orlando&rsquo;s dream and his going to the river-bank where Carlo
Magno and that other giant, Almonte, were fighting, and his
killing Almonte and his taking his sword and horse and
armour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say that Orlando had a dream; it was Carlo
Magno who had the dream about a young man whom he did not know,
and I told you that afterwards, when Orlando came and helped him
to fight Almonte, Carlo Magno recognised him as the young man in
his dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Buffo; my mistake.&nbsp; But it is rather like
it, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About his taking the giant&rsquo;s sword it is rather
like it, but that is not a bad thing in the teatrino, the people
must not be puzzled by too much variety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told me about Baiardo, Rinaldo&rsquo;s horse, who <!--
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>formerly belonged to Amadigi di Gaula, to whom he was
given by Berliante, another magician, who found him in the
desert.&nbsp; After the death of Amadigi, Berliante chose but
seven devils, put them inside Baiardo and turned him loose in the
forest, saying: &ldquo;This horse can only be dominated by a man
as strong as Amadigi.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this, several things
happened, of which I only remember that Baiardo kicked all the
sense out of Isolier, a Spanish cavalier who was trying to tame
him with his sword, not knowing the right way to do it, and a
nameless Englishman was involved in a duel.&nbsp; At last Rinaldo
came and, after working hard at Baiardo for an hour, struck him a
blow between the eyes with his mailed fist and thus tamed
him.&nbsp; Then Rinaldo mounted him and boasted of his triumph,
shouting in his humorous way: &ldquo;Now Baiardo is carrying
eight devils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you see Rinaldo getting Baiardo is not at all
like Orlando getting his horse Vegliantino; besides, Baiardo is
red, the colour of fire, and Vegliantino is white all over,
without one black hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call Orlando&rsquo;s horse
Vegliantino?&nbsp; Last year he was Brigliadoro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, if you please.&nbsp; Almonte called him
Brigliadoro because he had a golden bridle; but when Orlando took
him he called him Vegliantino because he was so
wide-awake&mdash;only slept with one eye at a time&mdash;always
kept the other open.&nbsp; You have good horses also in
England.&nbsp; I read in the <i>Giornale di Sicilia</i> that your
King Edward has a good horse who won the great race this year,
but I do not remember his name.&nbsp; It was not a reasonable
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name was Minoru.&nbsp; Do you think that a bad name
for a good horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Vegliantino is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is.&nbsp; Let us return to Malagigi.&nbsp;
Are you not going to tell me why he is no longer giving the
Christians the benefit of his services as magician?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>So he told me about Malagigi, who, it seems, had a
quarrel with Carlo Magno, in the course of which Malagigi
boasted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the Emperor of the World, but I am the Emperor
of the Inferno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlo Magno did not quite like this and responded by cursing
Malagigi, saying that he would not go to heaven when he
died.&nbsp; One would think that Malagigi must have had the
substance of this remark addressed to him before by persons who
had not troubled to wrap it up in the imperial language employed
by Carlo Magno.&nbsp; If so, it had never made any impression on
him, but now he began to think there might be something in
it.&nbsp; He had been a good man on the whole and a Christian,
nevertheless, as a sorcerer he had no doubt diabolised a little
too freely.&nbsp; To be on the safe side, he determined to repent
and, as these things do not get over the footlights unless they
are done in the grand manner, he began by burning his magical
books, all except one, and they were the books of Merlin, whose
disciple he had been.&nbsp; He next dropped his name of Malagigi,
because it had been given him by the devils in council, and
called himself Onofrio.&nbsp; He still kept on terms with his
confidential private devil, Nacalone, whom he now summoned and to
whom he spoke these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Convey me to some peaceful shore where I may repent of
my sins and die of grief in a grotto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we came to this&mdash;I could not help it, I was full of
small complaints that morning&mdash;I exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Buffo, this makes consecutive fifths with
his cousin Bradamante dying of grief in the grotto at
Trapani.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He admitted that it would have been better if one of them had
had the originality to die in bed as a Christian or an ordinary
man does, or to be killed in mortal combat, but there it was, it
was the will of heaven and could not be altered.&nbsp; It seemed
rather an invitation to the shortener of <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>the story,
but the same people do not come to the theatre every night and
those who had missed the death of Bradamante would be pleased to
see Malagigi die.</p>
<p>The nearest peaceful shore with a suitable grotto known to
Nacalone happened to be in Asia; he put his master on his back
and flew off with him apologising for carrying him so far, but
there was not really much trouble about it, because his wings
were strong and the journey was accomplished in safety.</p>
<p>Malagigi sat repenting in his Asian grotto, like S. Gerolamo
in the pictures.&nbsp; He found a stone with a hole in it into
which he stuck a cross made of two pieces of wood tied together
with dried grass, and to this cross he prayed.&nbsp; In the
intervals of prayer and repentance he gathered the herb malva,
dried it, powdered it, mixed it with water into paste, formed it
into cakes, baked them in the sun and ate them.&nbsp; When his
time came, he died, and gradually his corpse became a skeleton,
but his spirit still dwelt within because it was so
ordained.&nbsp; His dying did not surprise me&mdash;to be born is
to enter upon the path which even magicians must tread and which
leads to the inevitable door&mdash;nor was I alarmed about his
spirit remaining inside his skeleton&mdash;it gave him a touch of
originality after all and differentiated his death from that of
Bradamante whose soul I had seen extracted by an angel; but I
could not help being seriously uneasy about his burning all his
books.&nbsp; Each book had a devil chained inside it, and when
Malagigi opened a book its devil used to appear for
instructions.&nbsp; As long as he was repenting, they might
perhaps be trusted to behave themselves; but after his death, in
spite of its being somewhat equivocal, I was afraid that all
these devils, and Merlin had an extensive library, would escape
and be free to do as they chose.&nbsp; The buffo assured me,
however, that no harm would come of it, and as he knew what was
ordained by the will of heaven I was ready to take his word;
besides, there was still the one unburnt book and this was the
home of Nacalone, who might be powerful <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>enough to
avert disasters.&nbsp; So Malagigi&rsquo;s body remained in the
grotto, dead and yet not dead.</p>
<p>Then a time came when his son Argantino happened to be
travelling in Asia with his second cousin Guido Santo.&nbsp;
Accompanied by Costanzo, a Turk, whom Argantino had defeated and
baptised, the two knights came to the dreadful enchanted grotto
and entered it to see whether perhaps it might contain anything
good to eat.&nbsp; Costanzo did not enter, they sent him off to
collect a quantity of wood to make a fire because it was a chilly
evening.&nbsp; When their eyes had become accustomed to the dim
light, they discerned a tomb whereon was this inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>IN HOC LOCO PAX.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guido knelt down to pray, saying: &ldquo;I perceive here a
sepulchre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Argantino kneeling by his side;
&ldquo;I wonder who in this peaceful grotto is sleeping his last
long sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the tomb opened by a miracle and a voice disturbed
their devotions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malagigi parler&agrave;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cousins trembled with horror as a skeleton rattled up
from the sepulchre and spoke thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the great magician Malagigi, and in obedience to
the command of heaven my spirit has here waited for this
day.&nbsp; To you, O my son Argantino! I confide the one book of
magic which remains to me.&nbsp; To you, O Guido! I confide the
horse Sfrenato.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he delivered the two compliments to the two paladins; but
for the moment Sfrenato took the magical book and carried it in
his mouth as a cat carries her kitten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, listen to me.&nbsp; Terrible times are in
store for the Christians and it is God&rsquo;s ordinance that you
two shall preserve the faith.&nbsp; Swear to me therefore, O
Guido! that you will&rdquo;&mdash;and so forth.</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>When he had concluded his address, his prophetic spirit
was exhausted, as might perhaps have been anticipated, for the
speech was of portentous length, and the skeleton clattered down
again into the tomb, which closed by another miracle while a ball
of fire ran along upon the ground across the stage and back
again.&nbsp; Then Guido took his oath and spoke thus to
Argantino:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now depart.&nbsp; And you Turks! all of you,
tremble! for Guido shall be your destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this he vaulted upon Sfrenato, who curveted and whinnied
with joy at recognising his master.&nbsp; And so the two paladins
continued their journey; but before leaving the neighbourhood
they naturally made arrangements with the local marble-mason to
have the tomb closed in a proper and hygienic manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all this,&rdquo; said the buffo, &ldquo;happened
only last Friday, and why did you not come in time to see
it?&nbsp; It was very emotional.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
ARGANTINO</h3>
<p>As I had missed the emotional interview at the tomb the buffo
generously arranged that there should be a private repetition of
the scene specially for the young ladies and me; but it could not
be that afternoon because it would take time to prepare and we
had the appointment to go to his professor&rsquo;s house for his
singing lesson, and that also would take time.&nbsp; Before
singing one does a few exercises, the effect of which is to warm
up the throat and awaken the voice, because the warmer the
throat, the better the quality of the voice, and this had to be
got through before anyone could be allowed to listen.&nbsp; At
the proper moment I was taken to the professor&rsquo;s house and
introduced into the studio where the buffo, who had taken off his
collar to <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>do the exercises, sang extracts from
his repertorio, which includes <i>Otello</i>, <i>Rigoletto</i>,
<i>I Pagliacci</i> and <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>.</p>
<p>After he had sung one of his pieces, I made him my compliments
and congratulated his professor on the result of his teaching,
whereupon they made their excuses&mdash;I had come on an
unfortunate day, the voice was suffering from fatigue and the
piano was out of tune.&nbsp; I had not observed the fatigue, but
they were right about the piano and I agreed with the maestro,
who said it was time to order a new one.&nbsp; Not only was it
out of tune enough to curdle the milk, but they had endeavoured
to distract attention from its defects by crowding its lid with
rubbish till it resembled the parlour chimney-piece in a suburban
villa or the altar in a second-rate church.</p>
<p>As some old harridan when bidden to the christening of her
great-niece fumbles among such ornaments of her giovent&ugrave;
tempestosa as have been refused by the pawnbroker, and choosing
the least suitable decks herself out therein, thinking thus to
honour the festa&mdash;even so on this piano were accumulated
artificial flowers, photographs in metal frames, a sprinkling of
glass vases in wire cages that jangled, a couple of crockery pigs
to bring good luck and a few statuettes and busts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Buffo,&rdquo; I inquired, &ldquo;who is that
silver saint upon the piano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a saint,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it is only
un musicista qualunque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks about the shape of Mozart,&rdquo; I said,
wondering what he was doing in that galley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not remember his name,&rdquo; said the buffo,
&ldquo;it is written on him in front; it is not a reasonable
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought me the bust and I, thinking that, to harmonise with
the musical atmosphere of the studio, it should have been
Leoncavallo or Mascagni, found that it was even more out of tune
than the shameless piano it had been standing on.&nbsp; It was
<span class="smcap">betkoven</span>, with every letter <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>distinctly legible through the thick silver paint with
which it was covered.</p>
<p>These foreign names are so puzzling.&nbsp; At an afternoon
party in Palermo I once had a conversation with a gentleman who
told me that Bellini was the king of opera-writers and the
emperor of composers.&nbsp; To pass a few hours with people who
consider Bellini to have written the last note in music is as
restful and refreshing as to dream away an August afternoon in a
peaceful backwater, forgetting that there is a river running to
the sea.&nbsp; After Bellini, the gentleman mentioned Beethoven,
who, it seems, studied in Italy, and that is why his music is so
melodious.&nbsp; The more accessible writers on Beethoven know as
little about this studying in Italy as they know about the
Palermitan spelling of his name, but it must be right, because
how otherwise could he have acquired his astonishing power of
producing the true Italian melody?&nbsp; And there is another
German musician who is even more melodious and more Italian in
style than Beethoven and therefore a greater musician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he also study in Italy?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what was his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all come here to study, and his name was
Sciup&egrave;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I divined that this German melodist could only be either the
Viennese Schubert or the French Pole Chopin, but with my English
pronunciation I failed to make the distinction.&nbsp; Then a
young lady, who had been sitting near, proposed to clear the
matter up by playing a piece composed by Sciup&egrave;, and if I
would listen attentively I should understand why he is known as
the German Bellini.&nbsp; By this time I had made up my mind that
it must be Schubert and was expecting one of the songs
transcribed by Liszt, but she played Chopin&rsquo;s Funeral March
and told me that the composer had written besides a number of
operas and conducted them at Berlin.&nbsp; I acquiesced in what
appeared to be the will of heaven, saying:</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;Oh! yes, of course.&nbsp; How stupid of
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The buffo has a fine voice and has got far beyond appearing to
have learnt his songs diligently and to be delivering them
correctly.&nbsp; I suspect, however, that he did not pass that
way.&nbsp; He will soon have assimilated all that can be taught
about singing, and for the rest he is naturally an actor, one of
those few who are born with the strange power of appearing to
experience inwardly what they express outwardly, a power that his
life among the marionettes has strengthened and perfected.&nbsp;
But as to predicting his future, which is what he wanted me to
do, I suppose that only an expert, and perhaps not even an
expert, can tell from hearing a singer in a small room how he
will sound on the stage; and the voice is not everything, there
is the appearance and the question of how his personality will
affect the public, and the further question of how he will stand
the life and amalgamate with his fellows.&nbsp; So, like a good
Sicilian, I told him that there never was such a magnificent
voice, that I had never heard anyone sing so well and that I was
sure he would eclipse all previous tenors, which made everything
quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>The next day we had our private performance, and it began with
Guido Santo and Argantino at the dreadful enchanted grotto of the
great magician Malagigi.&nbsp; I was glad to see Argantino; it
was nearly as good as seeing Malagigi in his habit as he lived
because, although the son only had one diabolical book, yet in
his personal appearance he strikingly resembled the father, being
indeed the same marionette and distinguished chiefly by his
wings, which he inherited from his mother Sabina who was a
witch.&nbsp; Argantino always wore his wings even when he used to
wear armour, and on his shield he bore the portrait of a devil so
that everyone should know at a glance the kind of man he
was.&nbsp; After the angel tells him he is to do the magic for
the Christians he appears clothed as a pilgrim with wings, and in
this way, although it is the same marionette and both Malagigi
and Argantino are magicians, <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>confusion is
avoided&mdash;at least the buffo said that was the intention.</p>
<p>There was another thing I should have been sorry to
miss.&nbsp; I had hitherto supposed the dictionaries to be right
in defining a miracle as an event contrary to the established
course of nature, but the buffo took me behind the scenes to
study the miracle by which the tomb opened.&nbsp; There were
three or four strings so arranged that if anyone pulled them the
tomb could not remain closed.&nbsp; The buffo pulled them and the
tomb opened.&nbsp; Nothing less contrary to the ordinary course
of nature could be imagined.&nbsp; It would be interesting to
know whether other miracles would similarly falsify their
definition if one could have a buffo to take one behind and
disclose the secret of how they are performed.</p>
<p>The second scene was a Ballo Fantastico, which was given to
take the taste of the tomb and the skeleton out of our
mouths.&nbsp; It was done by a heavy Turk who danced cumbrously;
presently his arms detached themselves and became transformed
into devils who danced separately; then his legs followed their
example; then his head descended from his trunk and, on reaching
the stage, became transformed into a dancing wizard carrying a
rod of magic and beating time to the music; then, while the body
was dancing by itself, various devils came out of it followed by
several serpents that floated among the devils; after which it
developed a head, a neck, wings and a tail, so that it became
transformed into a complete dragon, and the wizard mounted upon
its back and rode about wizarding all the other creatures.&nbsp;
Altogether the original Turk became transformed into sixteen
different marionettes.</p>
<p>After this we had a funambolo or rope-dancer.&nbsp; The
curtain rose disclosing his rope ready for him, he entered and,
after bowing profusely, leapt up and sat first on the rope, then
on a seat at the back.&nbsp; Here he played with his pole,
holding it first with one hand then with the other, then
balancing it on his head and doing tricks with it.&nbsp; Then he
walked along the rope forwards and backwards <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>and danced,
doing his steps with great care and precision.&nbsp; After which
he sat down to recover his breath.&nbsp; Then he rope-walked
again, doing impossible things&mdash;that is, they would have
been impossible if he had not been sustained by many invisible
strings, which the buffo manipulated with wonderful skill.&nbsp;
I liked the funambolo even better than the wizard, he was
extraordinarily lifelike.</p>
<p>In the evening I became transformed into an ordinary member of
the public and saw the devils make the subterranean road.&nbsp;
The performance contained a great deal besides about Periglio, a
Turkish paladin, who, having been accused by the son of the
Emperor of China of helping the Christians, was condemned to be
beheaded.&nbsp; The father of his accuser with the other three
Emperors came to see him die; they stood at corners relentlessly
smoothing their beards and curling their moustaches with their
right fists and crying &ldquo;A Morire!&rdquo;&nbsp; Periglio in
chains was led on, blindfolded.&nbsp; The solemn headsman
followed, carrying his axe, and, as the boy left off turning the
handle of the mechanical piano, the cornet blasted a
broken-hearted minor ninth over the last chord of the funeral
march and prolonged it till&mdash;well, after all it was a
mistake; Periglio had not really helped the Christians; his
brother proved that, on the contrary, he had done them as much
damage as any Turk among the allied armies of 200,000 men.&nbsp;
So he was pardoned, and one of his friends gaily kicked the
executioner off the stage.&nbsp; The brothers embraced and then,
with their hands on their breasts, bowed to the audience to
acknowledge the applause; but they did not know they were
brothers, they had not yet recognised each other; that was to be
another emotional moment to come later on.</p>
<p>The kicking the executioner off the stage and the embracing
and bowing of the brothers were so absurdly natural that I
inquired about them, and it seemed that Gildo had thought of
these effects and carried them out.</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said the buffo, &ldquo;Gildo is
an artist.&nbsp; You should see him with Truffaldino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Truffaldino?&nbsp; Another cavaliere
errante?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the paladin who is a buffo.&nbsp; You should see
him toss his crown from one side of his head to the other and put
both his hands on his heart when he makes love to Angelica.&nbsp;
He only plays the fool a little the first night, and more and
more as the drama proceeds, until he dies by being pulled to
pieces by four horses.&nbsp; It is all done by Gildo, and the
audience laugh every night that Truffaldino appears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then we were taken to Vienna, where Guido Santo and Argantino
had arrived, but we only saw Argantino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Guido?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to
see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, well, you won&rsquo;t see him this evening,&rdquo;
replied the buffo.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only in the next room,
but he&rsquo;s much too busy to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baptising Christians&mdash;those who couldn&rsquo;t
make up their minds before whether they would be converted or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, we won&rsquo;t interrupt him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I had to be content with Argantino, who came with his book,
his rod of magic and his wings.&nbsp; After flying about for some
time in a hall with columns, he settled down, and someone entered
and told him the disquieting news about Pope Gregorio III being
shut up in Paris.&nbsp; But, knowing that it was the will of
heaven that the inhabitants should not perish, he summoned his
confidential family devil Nacalone by opening the book, just as a
rich man of to-day liberates infernal power by opening his
cheque-book.&nbsp; Nacalone was as comic as the mask Pasquino,
and tumbled to show his willingness to obey.&nbsp; He had a
string to his back so that he could be turned upside down and
made to stand on his head.&nbsp; He received his instructions and
flew off to execute them.</p>
<p>The Viennese columns disappeared and the devils, plenty of
them, all with wings and tails and horns, were shown, as <!--
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>in a vision, working at the subterranean road.&nbsp; Two
were sawing a block of stone; some flew up to use their hammers
and do work in the upper parts of the tunnel; one, who was
perhaps nervous or perhaps more of an artist and wanted to look
the part of a modern Palermitan workman, used his legs to climb a
ladder to reach his work; others were digging up the ground and
knocking down the walls; a devil wheeled an empty Sicilian cart,
painted with paladins, rapidly across the stage and after a
moment wheeled it back slowly because it was now heavily laden
with tools and cement; another kept coming with a basket of
stones on his shoulder and emptying them down in heaps.&nbsp; It
was a busy scene and much applauded, especially the cart.&nbsp;
The Viennese columns hid it from view.</p>
<p>The buffo was very proud of this scene, and no wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing like it in Dante.&nbsp; But
then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there would not be likely to
be.&nbsp; What is Dante?&nbsp; As versification, as language, his
poem is fine, splendid, supreme, above all other poetry books;
but as sense, what is it?&nbsp; And then again, why should Dante
go about to make me believe in devils?&nbsp; Me! the ruler of all
the devils in the teatrino!&nbsp; As though I did not know more
about devils than anyone.&nbsp; Dante is the Emperor of Words,
but the buffo is the Emperor of Deeds.&nbsp; And then his
obscurity!&nbsp; As a theme for discussion Dante is as obscure as
religion.&nbsp; One says: &lsquo;It is so.&rsquo;&nbsp; While
another says: &lsquo;It is not so.&rsquo;&nbsp; As men discuss a
melon and one says: &lsquo;Inside it is red.&rsquo;&nbsp; While
another says: &lsquo;Inside it is white.&rsquo;&nbsp; Who can
bear testimony to the truth of Dante&rsquo;s words?&nbsp; We
cannot cut his poem open and see his inner meaning.&nbsp; Whereas
I have cut my inferno open for you.&nbsp; I have shown you what
it is like inside, and you can bear testimony to the truth of the
subterranean road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The buffo told me that the Christians in Paris were not armed,
but they all got safely away to Montalbano.&nbsp; During the
siege, the Pope directed the defence, and the people, following
his commands, threw their furniture over the <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>walls with
the intention of damaging the enemy; but the Turkish Emperors had
made a study of the art of war and taught their men how to hold
their shields over their heads, and thus they warded off the
chairs and tables and were able to creep along under cover,
approach the city, climb up the walls and descend into the
piazza.&nbsp; The first who entered went round to open the gates
and let the rest in.&nbsp; As soon as they had recovered from
their surprise at finding that the inhabitants had all escaped,
they began to commit sacrileges.&nbsp; Balestrazzo, Emperor of
Turgovia, occupied the principal church of Paris as a stable for
his horses.&nbsp; Rainello, a nephew of the traitor Gano di
Magonza, wishing to do a bravery, went into a church and cried
with a loud voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take down that crucifix; it is only wood; if it had
been a god I should not have denied the faith.&nbsp; Take it
away.&nbsp; There is only one God and Mahomet is his
prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this he leapt on the altar, drew his sword, and was about
to hew the crucifix into pieces when a thunderbolt struck
him.&nbsp; As he was the first to lay hands upon the sacred
images, so he was the first to be struck.&nbsp; But he recovered;
he did not die of the thunderbolt; it was the will of heaven that
he should live to be killed by Guido Santo.</p>
<p>It was a pity that I had to go to Calatafimi and could not
stay for all this, but before I went I had the satisfaction of
seeing Ettorina go mad.&nbsp; At first she was hardly more than
slightly unhinged, yet she was mad enough to enter the
enemy&rsquo;s camp by night.&nbsp; The sentinel had just been
awakened by the corporal, but she paid no more attention to them
than they to her.&nbsp; Nor did she shrink from making
consecutive fifths, or downright octaves, with Costanzo as she
crossed the stage, going away to fetch a quantity of wood to
light a fire because it was a chilly evening; but, as the buffo
pointed out, she had a sufficient dramatic reason to justify the
licence.&nbsp; Presently, like the laden Sicilian cart, she
staggered back with her faggots and disappeared.&nbsp; In a few
moments we saw the fitful glare from <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>the
conflagration she had kindled dancing on the combustible pavilion
which took up all the back of the scene.&nbsp; Various Turkish
soldiers entered to investigate the cause of the unwonted light,
but they did not return to report, she killed them all, one after
the other; and this gave time which the buffo utilised by
applying a match from below, and, while the pavilion blazed and
the audience applauded, Ettorina in her burnished armour went as
mad as Tilburina in her white satin till the curtain fell.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
THE ESCAPE FROM PARIS</h3>
<p>Although I had to miss a great deal that it would have been
interesting to see on the stage, I spent a couple of mornings
with the buffo in his workshop helping to make the scene of the
people escaping, which was perhaps even better than being among
the audience later.&nbsp; I think he is most happy when he is
holding up the mirror to nature and reproducing modern Palermitan
life as it appears to him.&nbsp; He enjoyed the devils and the
subterranean road, but the inhabitants of Paris in modern
costume, each saving his most precious object and escaping with
the Pope through the subterranean road to Montalbano, was a
larger canvas and gave him more opportunities.&nbsp; As a
creative artist he is in the fortunate position of being up to a
certain point his own impresario, stage-manager and
performer.&nbsp; Nevertheless he has to rely on the co-operation
of his father and Gildo, and there is always the public to be
considered, therefore it is possible that some of the things we
made and contemplated in the workshop did not get so far as to be
presented on the stage.</p>
<p>There was a sluggard carrying a mattress under each arm; and a
drunkard carrying a bottle of wine, a real glass bottle that
would catch the light and make an effect.&nbsp; Another man had
on his back a table and was carrying a <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>plate, a
knife, fork, spoon and napkin; he was a glutton.&nbsp; The masks
Pasquino and Onofrio were making a comic escape and talking in
dialect; Pasquino was carrying his wife Rosina on his shoulder
and a pillow in his hand, and Onofrio was saving an article of
crockery made at Caltagirone.&nbsp; And because the buffo was
studying to become a singer he had made a musician:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot show his voice,&rdquo; he complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be practising a solfeggio,&rdquo; I suggested,
&ldquo;which you could sing for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this was
not treating the buffo&rsquo;s voice with proper respect.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or put a piece of music-paper in his hand and make him a
composer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&nbsp; But what is written on the
music-paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;<i>Stornelli Montagnoli</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to hum meditatively:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/music1.jpg">
<img alt="Music in the Play" src="images/music1.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp;
In the first place it is not yet known in Palermo, and when it
is, it will be so popular that no one in particular will think of
saving it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;make it that
he has just discovered an entirely new resolution of the dominant
seventh and has written it down before he forgets it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; And this is the painter; he has his
easel and a picture which he has only just begun; that is more
precious to him than all the pictures he has finished because it
is so full of hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Buffo.&nbsp; And where is the miser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Caspita!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
clever you are!&nbsp; Of course there must be a miser.&nbsp; We
will make him at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we selected an old man marionette who happened to <!-- page
84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>have
nothing particular to do at the moment, and got a piece of
sacking out of which we made a bag and filled it&mdash;not with
gold&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the buffo, &ldquo;that must be one of
the things the people do not see, they must imagine the
gold.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then we loaded the miser with his bag and
added him to the crowd of fugitives.</p>
<p>And he had made a woman saving a mouse-trap; she was a
suffragette.&nbsp; That was because he had read in the
<i>Giornale di Sicilia</i> that in England a meeting of
suffragettes had been dispersed by letting mice in among
them.&nbsp; The buffo&rsquo;s suffragette had argued thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all the world there are mice; Montalbano will be no
exception.&nbsp; How do I know what sort of house I shall have
there?&nbsp; It will probably be over-run with mice.&nbsp; If I
take this trap with me, at least I shall be able to catch some of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned out that she had to sleep on the floor in someone
else&rsquo;s house like a fugitive from Messina, and the
mouse-trap came in very handy.</p>
<p>And he had made a chemist who was saving a medicine chest and
a few instruments.&nbsp; The chemist had argued thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Montalbano there will be no order.&nbsp; Here in
Paris the restaurants are well-managed and the food is
good.&nbsp; How can I tell what sort of food they will give us
there?&nbsp; Very likely we shall have to depend a great deal
upon chance.&nbsp; I will take these instruments and medicine and
earn money by curing those who will be sure to be upset by the
badness of the food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a man came weeping; his father had died the day before and
there had not been time to bury the body, but it had been put
into a coffin and the undertaker&rsquo;s men were laughing
because the son was rich and had promised to pay them extra for
carrying the body to Montalbano and burying it there; but the son
did not see they were laughing, he was in front to show them the
way.</p>
<p>Two boys came along, each saving a marionette, one had <!--
page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>Orlando, the other Rinaldo; they forgot that they were
escaping and stopped to make the paladins fight; a third boy came
and said they were his marionettes and the others had stolen
them, and the boys left Orlando and Rinaldo lying on the stage
and began to fight among themselves till their three mothers
followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quick, be quick, you silly boys, be quick,&rdquo;
shouted the mothers, hustling everything before them&mdash;boys,
marionettes and all&mdash;as an autumn hurricane sweeps away the
fallen leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that man doing?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one standing in the corner there&mdash;he seems to
have a camera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; He has been sent by the
Cinematograph Company to reproduce the scene for their
show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a capital idea; the
people will like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And two men were dragging a heavy bundle along on the ground
between them, and I asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the bundle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clothes,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>And there was a woman carrying a hen in a basket, and the hen
escaped from the basket, laid an egg in the middle of the stage
and cackled back into Paris; but the woman saved the egg and
said: &ldquo;Better an egg to-day than a hen
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another woman was carrying her baby on one arm and leading a
child by the hand, and the child was crying because it had to
walk too fast and was tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the astronomer,&rdquo; said the buffo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that his umbrella under his arm?&nbsp; It seems too
long and too bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that is Halley&rsquo;s comet which he has predicted
for next spring.&nbsp; He does not want to leave it behind, the
Turks might destroy it and he would lose his
reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>There was the boy from the barber&rsquo;s shop opposite;
he had been playing with a black kitten when the alarm came and
he joined the fugitives just as he was, in his white tunic with
the kitten in his arms and a comb stuck in his bushy hair.&nbsp;
And there came a troop of old women, chattering and shuffling
along and understanding no more about it all than I should have
understood if I had not had my buffo, my programme
raisonn&eacute;, to explain it.</p>
<p>Then I said: &ldquo;Buffo mio, we have had a musician and a
painter, where is the poet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there came a pale,
Alfred de Musset youth with long hair, a roll of paper and a
quill pen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know what he is saying?&nbsp; He
is saying: &lsquo;Better to embrace and be betrayed than to
suffer and die in ignorance.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the philosophy of the buffo?&rdquo; I
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the philosophy of the poet,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather beyond the public?&nbsp; Will
they understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public won&rsquo;t hear that; it is only for you
and me.&nbsp; There are many things we do not tell the public
because they are the public; but we understand because we are
artists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; And then if we have a poet we must
have a critic&mdash;won&rsquo;t this one do? he has a book;
perhaps he is going to review it, or perhaps it is his
encyclop&aelig;dia to save him from making mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like, he shall be the critic; only then you
ought to tell me what he is saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is saying: &lsquo;I despise everything because it is
not something else.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, bravo!&nbsp; That is better than what the poet
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my dear Buffo, I am not going to admit that.&nbsp;
Besides, it is not true of all critics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I said is not true of all poets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we don&rsquo;t like what we have made them
say, let us have someone to follow and show them where they are
both wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; Let me see.&nbsp; That will be
when they have had time to think it over.&nbsp; That will be the
Cold Dawn of the following morning.&nbsp; We will now make the
Aurora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we found a disengaged lady marionette and began to dress
her in a piece of cobwebby grey muslin from which the last few
spangles had not yet dropped.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure that this is not going too
far.&nbsp; Do you think we can really show the Cold Dawn of the
following morning escaping out of Paris by the underground
road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must go; she will be wanted at Montalbano to show
some of the people that they have saved the wrong
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That is what people so
often do when they travel, they leave behind them the things they
want most and take a lot of other things that are useless.&nbsp;
Now, that resolution of the dominant seventh was hardly worth
saving&mdash;at least it was not really new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stole it out of the works of the musician whose bust
was on your maestro&rsquo;s piano the other day, the one with the
Dutch name who lived in Vienna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you invented what the critic said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&nbsp; Your poet reminded me of something
in Walt Whitman and I twisted it round and gave it to the
critic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Walt Whitman?&nbsp; Is he another
Dutchman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an American poet, but his mother had a Dutch
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he come to the teatrino?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never came to Europe.&nbsp; I wish he had been to
the teatrino.&nbsp; He would have liked your Escape from Paris,
but perhaps he would not have cared so much for the
paladins.&nbsp; He wrote something about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had seen the end of the story, when the angel
takes Guido Santo&rsquo;s soul out of his mouth, I believe he
would have said that instead of flying up to heaven he flew
across the Atlantic with it and installed it &lsquo;amid the <!--
page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>kitchenware&rsquo; to animate all the machinery and
things in one of the Exhibitions held by the American Institute
in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what he said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; What he said was that all that world of
romance was dead:</p>
<blockquote><p>Passed to its charnel vault&mdash;laid on the
shelf&mdash;coffin&rsquo;d with crown and armour on,<br />
Blazon&rsquo;d with Shakespeare&rsquo;s purple page,<br />
And dirged by Tennyson&rsquo;s sweet sad rhyme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is not true.&nbsp; But of course if he never
came to the teatrino he could not know.&nbsp; Americans do come
to the teatrino.&nbsp; I never know which are Americans and which
are English; for the English come too.&nbsp; They come in the
winter and the spring, and when they are pleased with some stage
trick&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean with some miracle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;it is the same
thing.&nbsp; When they are pleased with some stage miracle, they
clap their hands and applaud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nice and sympathetic of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they shout out loud and cry: &lsquo;Bravo,
very good night.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Buffo!&nbsp; Is that really what they
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they shout: &lsquo;Bravo, very good night,&rsquo;
and it is a pleasure to hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so.&nbsp; I must come in the winter next
time and hear them say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all ask me some questions.&nbsp; I know what they
mean, but I cannot speak to them, and, if you please, will you
write down for me in English what I shall tell you, so that I can
show them the paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear Buffo, any little thing of that
kind.&nbsp; If any of them come to see the Escape from Paris, I
should think they will have a good many questions to ask.&nbsp;
For instance, there is the Aurora&rdquo;&mdash;He was finishing
her off by putting a silver fillet round her hair and a shining
star <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>upon her forehead&mdash;&rdquo;I cannot help it, but I
still feel unhappy about her.&nbsp; She does not explain
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will not signify.&nbsp; We must leave room for the
imagination to play&mdash;not too much, but it is a mistake to be
too exact.&nbsp; There must be some mystery which the public can
take in any way they choose.&nbsp; It is like the nuts on the
bicycle, they must not be left loose, but they must not be
screwed too tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gave way, saying: &ldquo;I suspect you are right.&nbsp; It
flatters the spectators to feel that they are helping the
performance by using their imagination.&nbsp; And if they
don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;well, they can think they do and
that flatters them again.&nbsp; And there is another reason why
we must not tell the public everything&mdash;it would take too
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes!&nbsp; We must not bore the public or they will
not come again to the teatrino, and then where would the money
come from to pay for my singing lessons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we let the Cold Dawn follow among the rest.&nbsp; There
were half a dozen rollicking blue-jackets off the warship in the
port, they had been spending the evening with their girls and
were escaping with them.&nbsp; When I objected that Paris was a
sea-port town only in a Bohemian sense, he replied that that was
enough for him; and when I said that if the sailors really had a
ship anywhere near, they would have done better to escape by sea,
he complained that I was being fastidious.</p>
<p>There were soldiers arm-in-arm and singing, they had been
interrupted while drinking in a wine-shop in a side street off
the Via Macqueda and were saving the marsala which they had not
finished.</p>
<p>After them came the maresciallo dei carabinieri in the uniform
he wears for a festa, with a plume in his three-cornered
hat.&nbsp; He was a broad, beefy fellow, taller than the
soldiers, being made of a marionette who is usually a
giant.&nbsp; He came swinging along, all so big and so burly,
followed by a lady, showily dressed, who walked mincingly and was
saving a pair of pink satin shoes and a powder-puff.&nbsp; She
<!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>kept calling to him to stop, she wanted to speak to
him.&nbsp; But he would not listen, he was not going to pay any
attention to her&mdash;not in his gala uniform, it would not have
been proper.&nbsp; Besides, there were people looking.</p>
<p>A blind musician with a broken nose and a falsetto voice was
led by his mate who carried a &lsquo;cello.&nbsp; An interrupted
wedding party followed, and school-children with their
professors, sick people out of the hospital with doctors and
nurses to help them, and a rabble of water-sellers, shoe-blacks,
pedlars and men pushing carts.</p>
<p>Then followed the paladinessa Ettorina still mad, so mad that
they were dragging her along and forcing her to escape while she
struggled to get free and did not want to go, because a mad
person does not understand danger.&nbsp; And paladins and
warriors came&mdash;Amantebrava, Lungobello, Ottonetto and many
more whose names I do not remember.</p>
<p>Last of all came Pope Gregorio III.&nbsp; He was not one to
leave the city till the last of his flock had been saved.&nbsp;
He wore his tiara and was in white robes with a red cross front
and back; he carried his crosier in his left hand and on his
right thumb was a diamond ring which sparkled as he blessed the
people.&nbsp; So he passed with his Secretary of State, his
cardinals, his bishops, his monsignori, his acolytes, his
chamberlains, his Guardia Nobile and his Swiss Guard; some
carried lighted candles, some carried banners and others crosses;
some were swinging incense and others were intoning the psalm
<i>In Exitu Israel</i>.&nbsp; The solemn pomp of the procession
disappeared into the opening of the subterranean road and the
sound of the singing could no longer be heard.&nbsp; They were
all safely gone.&nbsp; The stage was empty.&nbsp; Yet the curtain
did not fall.</p>
<p>Then came a poor mad boy, a sordo-muto, who had been
overlooked.&nbsp; He was in a great hurry, making frightful
inarticulate noises and running this way and that, being too much
alarmed to go straight.&nbsp; Before he had found the mouth of
the tunnel the curtain fell and we did not see what became of
him.&nbsp; He may have been left behind after all.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
THE BUFFO&rsquo;S HOLIDAY</h3>
<p>I do not remember who started the idea that the buffo should
come to Catania with me; it grew up, as inevitable ideas do,
without any of us being sure whether he suggested it, or Papa, or
Gildo, or one of the sisters, or I, and it became the chief
subject of conversation in the Greco family for days.</p>
<p>It would not be true to say that he had never been away from
Palermo, because when he was a boy all the family went to try
their fortune in Brazil and stayed there five years running a
marionette theatre; when they returned to Palermo, they left
behind them in South America the eldest son, Gaetano, who still
keeps a teatrino there.&nbsp; But the buffo saw no more of South
America than he has seen of Sicily and, except for this five
years in Brazil and an occasional day in the country round
Palermo, had never been outside his native town.&nbsp; But he
knew that Catania was on the other side of the island and near
the sea, and expected it to be hotter than Palermo because of the
propinquity of Etna.&nbsp; He paid no attention to my assurances
that the temperature would be about the same and said he should
bring his great-coat, not on account of the heat, but because he
hoped that if he was seen with it he might be taken for an
English tourist.</p>
<p>We did not start from Palermo together.&nbsp; I had to go to
Caltanissetta, which is on a line that branches off at S.
Caterina Xirbi from the main line between Palermo and
Catania.&nbsp; We arranged to meet at the junction three days
after I left Palermo.&nbsp; I got there from Caltanissetta just
before the train from Palermo arrived, and the buffo was <!--
page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>looking out of the window.&nbsp; As soon as he saw me on
the platform he got down and came to me saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I am so glad to see you again; now everything will
be all right.&nbsp; I have been wretched ever since you went
away.&nbsp; I have not been able to eat by night or to sleep by
day for thinking of you.&nbsp; And this has been going on for two
whole months; but now I shall recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we got into the train and pursued our journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have brought your great-coat,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I am to be an English
gentleman I shall have to wear it in Catania.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t it do if you carry it over your
arm?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because then they would see
my other coat, and that is so dilapidated they would suspect the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your clothes are quite good enough for any English
gentleman anywhere,&rdquo; I pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not so good as yours,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;the teatrino is dirty and they soon wear out.&nbsp; My
great-coat appears to be fresh because I seldom put it on.&nbsp;
I shall use it in Catania to conceal the shabbiness of my other
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be so particular.&nbsp; My father when he
travelled in Italy did not pay so much attention to his personal
appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never told me about your father.&nbsp; Did he
travel for some English firm?&nbsp; Was it tiles? or perhaps
sewing-machines?&nbsp; They pay better, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not travel for any firm.&nbsp; He was a
barrister, an avvocato, and travelled for recreation during the
Long Vacation.&nbsp; I can tell you how he used to dress, because
just before I left London I copied part of a letter he wrote to
my mother, and I have it in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the extract from my father&rsquo;s letter which I read
to the buffo; it is dated H&ocirc;tel des Bergues, Geneva, 1
October, 1861:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Reading the <i>Times</i> of Friday
this morning I saw a letter signed G.U. which I have no doubt is
a mistake for J.U. and means John Unthank and which signifies he
and his family are in Paris.&nbsp; It is a letter complaining of
the shabby costume of Englishmen and is a foolish letter but it
will have the effect of making me furnish myself with a new
wideawake or something of that sort at Paris for my present
wideawake has got another hole in it and is really very bad
though I don&rsquo;t know why it should wear so fast as I take
great care of it and am rather disappointed that it should fall
to pieces.&nbsp; Mr. Unthank pointed out to me on the Lake of
Como that my dressing-gown which I always wear travelling is out
at elbows which indeed I find it is but that fact seemed to
grieve Mr. Unthank less than the shabbiness of my hat and he
offered to give me a new one that is a wideawake of his own which
had been newly lined and not worn as he said since it was lined
if I would throw my old wideawake away.&nbsp; I consented but I
left Milan before he had an opportunity of performing his
promise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was kind of your father&rsquo;s friend to offer him
his old hat; don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very kind of him.&nbsp; But, you see, he had his
reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, he did not want to be seen with anyone so
badly dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what he says in his letter to the
<i>Times</i>.&nbsp; I copied that in the British Museum.&nbsp; He
does not mention my father by name, he merely speaks of
well-dressed Englishmen in Paris (by which he means people like
himself) frequently seeing a respectable professional man
disguised as an omnibus conductor or cab-driver and &lsquo;being
compelled to stand talking with a vulgar-looking object because
they have unfortunately recognised an old acquaintance and not
had time to run across the road to avoid him.&rsquo;&nbsp; My
father, no doubt, thought of Mr. Unthank&rsquo;s conversations
with him at Como and Milan and said to himself,
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s me.&rsquo;&nbsp; The cap fitted him and he
put it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;Excuse me; your father cannot have put the cap
on, he says he had to leave Milan too soon for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my dear Buffo, I am so sorry.&nbsp; When I said the
cap, I did not mean the wideawake, I was only using an English
idiom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, I understand.&nbsp; We also have a similar
expression, but it is not about hats, it is about boots, I think,
or coats.&nbsp; I will find out and tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father does not say he &lsquo;had to leave&rsquo;;
he only says he left; and my mother, who agreed with his friends
and thought his taste in dress deplorable, believed that he ran
away to escape from Mr. Unthank&rsquo;s hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but a hat is always worth something.&nbsp; I should
have waited for the hat.&nbsp; Was it really a very bad
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not remember it, I should think it must have been
pretty bad.&nbsp; The dressing-gown was awful.&nbsp; It was
maroon, and his friends called it his wife&rsquo;s mantle.&nbsp;
After he left off wearing it, it was given to us children for
dressing up.&nbsp; It was no use for anything else and it was not
much use for that.&nbsp; So you see, Buffo, you need not trouble
about your clothes if you want to appear English.&nbsp; You do
not look in the least like a cab-driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not; but I think it will be safer for me not to
be an Englishman.&nbsp; All this about your father&rsquo;s
dressing-gown happened half a century ago, and the letter and the
article in the <i>Times</i> must have done some good because the
English gentlemen who come to the teatrino do not dress like that
now.&nbsp; You are always beautifully dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, Buffo, but if that is more than
merely one of your Sicilian compliments, it only shows that I
inherit my ideas about dress from my mother rather than from my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I had better be a Portuguese gentleman from
Rio, a friend of yours, over on a visit, and you shall be a
Sicilian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be a couple of cavalieri erranti like Guido
Santo and Argantino on their travels.&nbsp; But I do not think
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>it will quite do for me to be a Sicilian.&nbsp; I cannot
talk dialect and I cannot gesticulate.&nbsp; And then, am I not
too well dressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will not matter; you shall be an aristocratic
Sicilian, they are often quite well dressed.&nbsp; And as for the
dialect and the gesticulation, it is now the fashion among the
upper classes to speak Tuscan and not to gesticulate.&nbsp; It is
considered more&mdash;I cannot remember the word, I saw it in the
<i>Giornale di Sicilia</i>, it is an English word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it is more chic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not exactly that and chic is a French word.&nbsp;
One moment, if you please.&nbsp; It is&mdash;we say lo
snobismo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; Very well; I will play the Sicilian snob,
but I never saw one so I shall have to do it extempore as Snug
had to play the part of Lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Snug? another American poet?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a joiner and lived in Athens at the time when
all the good things happened.&nbsp; But his father, the author of
his being, as we say, was an English poet and cast him for the
part of Lion in <i>Pyramus and Thisbe</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Thisbe? a wandering knight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Thisbe was the lady loved by Pyramus and was
acted by Flute the bellows-mender.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all in that
poet who said what I told you when we were making the Escape from
Paris&mdash;you remember, about holding the mirror up to
nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could read your English poets.&nbsp; I like
everything English.&nbsp; The Englishmen who come to the teatrino
are always good and kind&mdash;tutti bravi&mdash;I wish I were an
Englishman&mdash;a real one I mean, like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here were more compliments, so I replied: &ldquo;I wish I were
a Sicilian buffo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but you could not be that,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now I could have my hair cut short, grow a beard on my
chin, a pair of spectacles on my eyes and heels on my boots and
then I should only have to be naturalised.&nbsp; But you could
never be a buffo&mdash;not even an English one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>&ldquo;No; I suppose not.&nbsp; You see, I&rsquo;m too
serious.&nbsp; Gildo says I take a gloomy view of
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;why do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
poor mother&mdash;my adorata mamma, as you call her&mdash;used to
make the same complaint.&nbsp; She thought I inherited my
desponding temperament from my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you inherited your taste in dress from
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so.&nbsp; But I think I am like Orlando and your
other paladins, and that I am as I am because it was the will of
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is only another way of saying the same
thing,&rdquo; observed the buffo; which rather surprised me
because I did not know he took such a just view of the
significance of evolution.</p>
<p>On arriving at Catania we went to the albergo and, instead of
following the usual course and giving his Christian name and
surname, Alessandro Greco, he preferred to specify his profession
and describe himself as &ldquo;Tenore Greco.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
posted this up in the hall under my name, with the unexpected
result that the other guests ignored him, thinking the words
applied to me and that I was a tenor singer from Greece.</p>
<p>The first thing to be done was to go out and get something to
eat, and as we went along the buffo expressed his delight with
the appearance of Catania.&nbsp; He had no idea that such a town
could exist outside Palermo or Brazil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;yes, and I
shall always declare that it is beautiful.&nbsp; But, my dear
Enrico, will you be kind enough to tell me why it is so
black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my dear Buffo,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;is on
account of the lava.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you mean&mdash;the lava?&nbsp; What is this
lava that you speak of, and how does it darken the houses and the
streets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which I replied as follows: &ldquo;The lava is that mass of
fire which issues from Etna and then dissolves itself and <!--
page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>becomes formed into black rock, and, as it is
excessively hard, the people of Catania use it for building their
houses and for paving their streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not remember expressing myself precisely in these words,
but the buffo wrote me an account of his holiday and this is what
he says I said.&nbsp; It seems that I continued thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house, for example, is built of lava, this
pavement is lava, those columns are lava, that elephant over the
fountain is sculptured in lava, this is lava, that is lava,
everything is lava; even those&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop,&rdquo; interrupted the buffo, &ldquo;for
pity&rsquo;s sake stop, or I shall begin to think that you and I
also are made of lava.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reached the Birraria Svizzera and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hungry, Buffo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am always hungry.&nbsp; My subterranean road is
always ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s capital,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what particular fugitive would you like to send down
it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seppia and interiori di pollo,&rdquo; he replied
without hesitation.</p>
<p>Now the first of these is cuttle-fish and looks as though the
cook in sending to table something that ought to have been thrown
away had tried to conceal it by emptying a bottle of ink into the
dish; the second is un-selected giblets.&nbsp; So I replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll join
you.&nbsp; No one will believe I am a Sicilian unless I eat
maccaroni, and perhaps I will have a veal cutlet afterwards; that
will be more suited to my subterranean road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better have what I have,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;it is exquisite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; I replied gently.</p>
<p>So we ate our dinner and discussed what we should do during
the evening.&nbsp; He wanted to go to the marionette theatre, and
I was not surprised, for I remembered that the <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>vergers of
Westminster Abbey and of Salisbury Cathedral spend their holidays
making tours to visit other cathedrals; cooks go to Food
Exhibitions; Scotch station-masters come to London and spend
their time in the Underground railways; and English journalists
when they meet on an outing, say to one another:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a foggy morning; let us go in and split three or
four infinitives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I took him to the Teatro Sicilia and introduced him to the
proprietor, Gregorio Grasso, a half-brother of Giovanni Grasso,
and we went behind the scenes to study the difference between the
Catanian and the Palermitan systems.&nbsp; He was first struck by
the immense size of the place as compared with his own little
theatre; next by the orchestra which, instead of being a
mechanical piano turned by a boy, consisted of a violin, a guitar
and a double-bass played by men; and finally by the manner of
manipulating the figures, which distressed him so seriously that
he forgot he was a Portuguese gentleman and began to give
Gregorio a lesson to show him how much better we do things in
Palermo; but it came to nothing, because a method that produces a
good effect when applied to a small and fairly light marionette
will not do when applied to one that is nearly a metre and a half
high and weighs about fifty kilogrammes; it is like trying to
play an elaborate violin passage on the horn.&nbsp; Soon we were
politely invited to go to the front, where we were shown into
good places, and the performance began.&nbsp; In the auditorium
there was the familiar, pleasant, faint crackling of melon seeds
and peanuts which the people were munching as at home, and a man
pushing his way about among them selling lemonade, and water with
a dash of anise in it.</p>
<p>The buffo thought the marionettes of Catania were magnificent,
well-modelled and sumptuously dressed; but their size and their
weight make it impossible for them to move with the delicacy and
naturalness which he and his father and brother know so well how
to impart to those at <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>home.&nbsp; They may start fairly
well, but sooner or later the figure will betray to the public
the fatigue of the operator who is standing exhausted on the
platform behind, no longer capable of communicating any semblance
of life to the limbs of the puppet.&nbsp; He did not, however,
arrive at this conclusion all at once, for, in the course of the
performance when I asked him how it was that the marionettes of
Catania were not more expressive, he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it must be on account of the lava.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figures appear against the back-cloth and the operator
cannot reach forward to bring them nearer to the audience, thus
the front part of the stage is free&mdash;or rather it would be
free, but the public are permitted to stray on to it, and thus
the stage presents a picture of marionettes with two or three
live people sitting at each side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buffo mio,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;does it appear to you
to be a good plan that the public should go on the stage and
mingle with the paladins?&nbsp; It is not allowed in our own
theatre at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that it is a bad plan,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;it is true we do not allow it in Palermo; but one moment,
if you please, there is something coming into my head.&nbsp; Ah!
yes, it is about holding up the mirror to nature.&nbsp; Now here,
in Catania, this stage presents a truer mirror of nature than
ours in Palermo.&nbsp; For have you not observed in life that,
with the exception of a few really sensible people like you and
me, most men are merely puppets in the hands of others?&nbsp;
They do not act on their own ideas nor do they think for
themselves; also they adopt any words that are put into their
mouths.&nbsp; Now, it seems to me that the proportion of real men
compared with marionettes is not greater on this stage than we
observe it to be in life, and therefore we may say that the
proprietor of this theatre is following the advice of your
poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He noticed that one of the chief characteristics of the
Catanian marionettes comes into evidence when they are
fighting.&nbsp; Two of them take up their positions opposite each
<!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>other, sidling round and round like fighting cocks
preparing to set to; they raise their scimitars, cross them and
rub them one against the other, like butchers sharpening their
knives; after a certain time spent in this sword exercise, they
cross the stage and, turning suddenly round, face one another and
strike; the consequence of this man&oelig;uvre is that they both
fall to the ground.&nbsp; We were looking on at such a duel and
when the climax came the buffo rose to his feet and clapped his
hands expecting the rest of the public to join, but to his
surprise they remained cold, and declined &ldquo;to crown his
applause with their acquiescence,&rdquo; as he expressed
it.&nbsp; He turned wonderingly to the young man who was selling
lemonade and said, speaking with difficulty in broken Tuscan, as
a Portuguese gentleman from Rio might be expected to do:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Caro mio, why do not the public join me in
applauding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;it is
out of the question.&nbsp; You do not seem to be aware of the
identity of the marionette who has just been killed.&nbsp; He is
a Christian and the brother-in-law of Rinaldo.&nbsp; He is
Ruggiero, a very noble youth.&nbsp; The public do not applaud,
because they are sorry for his death and, besides, it would be an
insult to Rinaldo if they were to applaud at the death of his
brother-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this the buffo borrowed my handkerchief and wiped
away two tears, one from each of his eyes, then he returned it
politely and began mumbling to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;&nbsp; I inquired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why do you speak so low?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I was
merely reciting a prayer for the repose of the soul of poor
Ruggiero.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The next morning I was down before him and had nearly finished
my coffee when he came slowly and sadly into the
dining-room.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&ldquo;Good morning, Buffo mio, and I hope you have had
a good night and slept well after your long journey and your
evening at the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down, put his arm on the table and mournfully rested
his head on his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Enrico,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have passed a
night of horror.&nbsp; I did not get to sleep at all, and then I
was continually waking up again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Buffo,&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not nonsense.&nbsp; Ah! you do not know
what it is to lie awake all night, sleepless and trembling,
between sheets that are made of lava, and to hear footsteps and
the clanking of armour and to see Rinaldo shining in the dark and
threatening you as he holds over you his sword, Fusberta, and
shouts in your ear: &lsquo;How dare you applaud when my
brother-in-law is killed?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to enjoy his coffee, however, and to be ready for
plenty of exertion.&nbsp; He wanted a piece of lava to take home
with him, and would it not be possible to pick up a piece if we
went to the slopes of Etna?&nbsp; So we made inquiries and were
told where to find the station of the Circum-Etnea Railway and
started soon after breakfast for Patern&ograve;.&nbsp; The soil
was black with lava and the wind was tremendous and carried the
gritty dust into our mouths and down our necks.&nbsp; In that way
he got plenty of lava to take home, but he wanted a large piece,
and we could not stop the train and get out and break a piece of
rock off, besides, we had nothing to break it with.&nbsp; We were
like that old sailor in the poem who was surrounded by water,
water everywhere, but not a drop of a kind to satisfy his
immediate requirements.&nbsp; It was just as bad at
Patern&ograve;; from the station to the town all our energies
were required to get along in the blinding wind and the stinging
dust and then we had to have our luncheon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would you like for colazione,
Buffo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seppia and interiori di pollo, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he had to be a Sicilian and eat maccaroni with me, <!--
page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>because the inn could not provide what he wanted.&nbsp;
Altogether the day was perhaps something of a failure, and we
returned without the piece of lava.</p>
<p>In the evening we went to the Birraria Svizzera, and he ate
his seppia while I got through my maccaroni.&nbsp; When his
interiori di pollo came I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do my best to eat what you eat, not exactly but
as nearly as I can.&nbsp; Instead of a veal cutlet I will have
part of an esteriore di pollo.&nbsp; It rather surprises me that
you should always eat the same things.&nbsp; Gildo said you like
plenty of variety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I do,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at my
plate.&nbsp; Can you imagine a more delicious variety?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked and said: &ldquo;Certainly there is variety; I doubt
whether our English fowls could show so much.&nbsp;
But&mdash;well, as long as you like it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being rather tired after our day in the country we did not go
to any theatre, we stayed in the Birraria till bed-time talking
and listening to the music.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Next day was the last of the buffo&rsquo;s holiday, and I
proposed another excursion, but he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we pretend that we have come to Catania on an
excursion, and then we can spend the day in the city.&nbsp; I
want to buy some things to take home with me for my
sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly we looked in the shop-windows and chose three
ornamental combs made of celluloid for the three sisters, a
snuff-box for papa, made of dried bergamot skin smelling so as to
scent the snuff, and a pair of braces for Gildo.&nbsp; It seemed
a pity that the buffo should not have something also, so he chose
for himself a handkerchief with a picture of the elephant of lava
over the fountain in the piazza and he gave me in return a metal
pencil-case.&nbsp; Then the question of the piece of lava had to
be taken up again.&nbsp; We consulted the landlord, who produced
a bit&mdash;exactly <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>what was wanted and only one franc
fifty.&nbsp; We had been wandering about in search of it and
there it was all the time in the same house with us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you going to do with it,
Buffo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, everyone who goes to Catania brings home a piece
of lava.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what do they want it for?&nbsp; It might be a
neat chimney ornament, but you have no fireplace in your
house.&nbsp; Or you might use it as a paper-weight, but in your
family you scarcely ever write a letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me sadly for a moment and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were an artist and now you are being
practical.&nbsp; Usefulness is not everything.&nbsp; This piece
of lava will be for me an object of eternal beauty, and when I
contemplate it I shall think of the happy time we have spent here
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;O Buffo! don&rsquo;t go on like that or you
will make me cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the evening we went to the Teatro Machiavelli and saw a
performance by living players.&nbsp; In the first act a good
young man introduced Rosina to the cavaliere, who congratulated
him on having won the affections of so virtuous and lovely a
girl.&nbsp; The cavaliere gave a bad old woman one hundred
francs, and in return she promised to procure him an interview
with Rosina.&nbsp; The bad old woman persuaded Rosina to enter a
house in which we knew the cavaliere was.&nbsp; The good young
man asked the bad old woman what she had done with his girl; of
course she had done nothing with her, but we heard shrieks.&nbsp;
The good young man became suspicious, broke open the door of the
house and, on learning the worst, shot the bad old woman dead and
was taken by the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems as though it were going to be a very
interesting play,&rdquo; said the buffo when the curtain had
fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what do you think will
happen next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know that,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use asking me.&nbsp; I never saw a Sicilian
play in Rio.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;Of course not; I was forgetting.&nbsp; I should
say that the good young man will be acquitted because it was
justifiable homicide or that he will return after a short term of
imprisonment; in any case I think he will marry Rosina and live
happily ever after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You think it
will be a comedy.&nbsp; People who take a gloomy view of life
naturally expect something cheerful in the theatre.&nbsp; But
what if it is a tragedy?&nbsp; And how are you going to dispose
of the cavaliere?&nbsp; Is he to carry his wickedness through
your comedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want it to be a tragedy because you are a buffo, I
suppose.&nbsp; Now let me think.&nbsp; If you are
right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I could see my way to a tragic plot, the curtain rose
on Act II.&nbsp; The women of the village were going to Mass, but
Rosina, reduced to ragged misery, fell on the steps, not worthy
to enter.&nbsp; The cavaliere came by and offered her money,
which she indignantly spurned.&nbsp; A good old woman, who
happened to be passing, scowled at the cavaliere and kindly led
Rosina away.&nbsp; An old man returned from America, where he had
been for twenty years to escape the consequences of a crime the
details of which he ostentatiously suppressed.&nbsp; This was his
native village; he began recognising things and commenting on the
changes.&nbsp; Rosina came to him begging.&nbsp; He looked at her
and passed his hand over his eyes as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My girl, why are you begging at your age&mdash;so
young, so fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Old man, I am in ragged misery because my
father committed a crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crime!&nbsp; What crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Rosina told him about it and the escape of the criminal to
America.&nbsp; The tears in her voice were so copious that her
words were nearly drowned, but that did not signify; we were
intelligent enough to have already guessed the relationship
between them and we knew that she must be supplying the details
which he had suppressed.</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>He struggled with his surging emotions as he watched
her delivering her sad tale and we felt more and more certain
that we must be right.&nbsp; There came a pause.&nbsp; She buried
her face in her hands.&nbsp; The old man spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty years, did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was your mother&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concetta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dio mio!&nbsp; And your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mia figlia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mio padre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here they fell into each other&rsquo;s arms and the orchestra
let loose a passage of wild allegria which it had been holding in
reserve.&nbsp; The revelation of the cause of the ragged misery
followed and was nearing its conclusion when the cavaliere
happened to pass by.&nbsp; Rosina pointed him out to her father,
who first made a speech at him and then shot him dead.&nbsp;
Rosina wept over his body, although she hated him, and the
curtain fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very beautiful,&rdquo; said the buffo.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you still think it will be a comedy?&nbsp; I still
believe it will be a tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but we shall
soon know.&nbsp; Did not the old man listen well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; It was like life.&nbsp; Did you observe how
he made little calculations for himself while she told him the
story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and one could see it all agreed with what he
knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was like your father reading his friend&rsquo;s
letter.&nbsp; The cap fitted him and he put it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Buffo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he made as though he would stroke her hair and
drew back because he was not yet sure&mdash;oh, it was
beautiful!&nbsp; But there was one thing I did not quite
understand.&nbsp; Why did the cavaliere fall dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;Because the father shot him,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He aimed in the other direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also noticed that the old man fired to the right and
the cavaliere fell on his left, but that was only because of a
little defect of stage management.&nbsp; It does not do to be
fastidious.&nbsp; You must not forget that they are doing the
play as Snug the joiner did Lion, it has never been
written.&nbsp; It will go more smoothly next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; You see, I am not a regular
theatre-goer.&nbsp; There is another thing that puzzled me.&nbsp;
You remember the bad old woman in the first act who was
shot?&nbsp; Should you think I was being too fastidious if I
asked you why she rose from the dead and led Rosina kindly away
in the second act?&nbsp; No doubt it will be explained presently,
but, in the meantime, if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not rise from the dead; it was a different
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the same woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone could tell you are a Portuguese or an Englishman
or whatever you are&mdash;a foreigner of some kind; no Sicilian
would make such an objection.&nbsp; It was the same actress, but
a different character in the drama.&nbsp; That was either because
they have not enough ladies in the company, or because the lady
who ought to have taken one part or the other is away on a
holiday, or because the lady who acted wanted to show she could
do a good old woman and a bad old woman equally well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much.&nbsp; You can hardly
expect&mdash;But hush! they are beginning the third act, which
will explain everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curtain rose again.&nbsp; The background represented an
elegant circular temple built of sponge cake, strawberry ice and
spangles; it stood at the end of a perspective of columns
constructed of the same materials, and between the columns were
green bushes in ornamental flower-pots&mdash;all very pretty and
gay&mdash;&rdquo;molto bellissimo,&rdquo; as the buffo
said.&nbsp; The orchestra struck up a jigging tune in <!-- page
109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>six-eight time in a minor key with a refrain in the
tonic major, and a washed-out youth in evening dress with a
receding forehead, a long, bony nose, an eye-glass, prominent
upper-teeth, no chin, a hat on the back of his head, a brown
greatcoat over his arm, shiny boots, a cigarette and a
silver-topped cane, entered.&nbsp; I whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he dressed well enough for an Englishman?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; whispered the buffo, &ldquo;but this is no
Englishman.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see who it is and where we
are?&nbsp; This is the good young man in paradise.&nbsp; His
punishment has been too much for him and he has died in
prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Buffo mio,&rdquo; I objected, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
different person altogether; it&rsquo;s not a bit like
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a different actor&mdash;I think it
is&mdash;but it is the same character in the drama.&nbsp; That is
either because they have too many men in the company, or because
the actor who did the good young man in the first act has gone
home to supper and another is finishing his part for him, or
because&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think of any other reason just now,
and I want to hear what he is saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Except for his clothes, the creature on the stage was little
more than a limp and a dribble, but there was enough of him to
sing a song telling us in the Neapolitan dialect that his notion
of happiness was to stroll up and down the Toledo ogling the
girls.&nbsp; When he had finished acknowledging the applause he
departed and his place was taken by a lady no longer young, in
flimsy pale blue muslin, a low neck and sham diamonds.&nbsp;
There lingered about her a hungry wistfulness, as though she were
still hoping to get a few more drops of enjoyment out of the
squeezed orange of her wasted life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this must be Rosina,&rdquo; whispered the buffo;
&ldquo;Dio mio, how death has aged her!&rdquo;&nbsp; Seeing I was
about to speak, he interrupted me: &ldquo;It does not do to be
fastidious.&nbsp; No real Sicilian would make any
objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady sang a song telling us in the Neapolitan dialect that
her notion of happiness was to stroll up and down the <!-- page
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Toledo ogling the men.&nbsp; When she had finished
acknowledging the applause she departed and, almost immediately,
they both came on together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; exclaimed the buffo triumphantly;
&ldquo;they have met in paradise and are happy at
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They performed a duet in the Neapolitan dialect and showed us
how they strolled up and down the Toledo ogling one
another.&nbsp; After they had finished acknowledging the applause
the curtain fell and we all left the theatre.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know whether you are aware of what you have
done, but by making that temple of spangled pastry into heaven
you have wrecked your tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I gave up my tragedy as soon as I saw where we
were, and the play ended quite in your manner, didn&rsquo;t it?
like the Comedy of Dante.&nbsp; Or do you mean that you have any
doubts about that last act taking place in heaven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have many doubts about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit, of course, that it would have been more
satisfactory, and much clearer as a comedy, if we could have seen
them both die before they went to paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like me to tell you the plain,
straightforward, honest, manly, brutal truth about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much indeed, if you don&rsquo;t mind; but I should
not like you to strain yourself on my account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Buffo, I&rsquo;ll be careful.&nbsp; Now
listen.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe that the last act, as you
call it, had anything to do with the story.&nbsp; It was a
music-hall turn added at the end of the play merely to close the
entertainment and send the audience away in good
spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that wrecks your comedy.&nbsp; And if the play was
neither comedy nor tragedy, what was it?&nbsp; You cannot expect
a simple Portuguese gentleman from Rio to understand your
Sicilian dramas all at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have not time now to discuss the question
exhaustively, for if you do not go to bed immediately you will
never be up to-morrow in time to catch your train back to
Palermo, and if you are late what will papa say <!-- page
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>and what will the public think when they find nothing
ready in the teatrino?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true.&nbsp; Good night and thank you very much
for my holiday and for all you have done for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prego, prego; I thank you for giving me the pleasure of
your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I assure you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go on like this I shall begin to cry, and then I
shall not sleep at all, and that will be worse than sitting up to
discuss the play.&nbsp; So good night, finally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Buffo.&nbsp; You will forgive me if I do
not see you off in the morning; I do not want to get up at
half-past five.&nbsp; I wish you Buon viaggio.&nbsp; Give my love
to papa and Gildo and my respectful compliments to the
sisters.&nbsp; Have you got your lump of lava and all your other
goods?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Sleep well and do not
dream of Rosina and the good young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrivederci.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
THE NASCITA</h3>
<p>Once I was at Trapani in September, and observed in a small
shop in a back street some queer little dolls&rsquo; heads made
of wax.&nbsp; They seemed to form a set, some women and some men,
and there were hands of wax to match.&nbsp; I did not think much
about them, one cannot very well investigate everything one
notices in a Sicilian town, and, as I turned away, these little
heads were driven out of mine by Ignazio Giacalone, who was
coming down the street.&nbsp; He is a young avvocato whom I have
known since he was a student.&nbsp; He told me that he was going
to be married next day, and invited me to his wedding.</p>
<p>In the evening another friend of mine, also an avvocato,
Alberto Scalisi, came to the albergo to take his coffee and, as
we all sat smoking and talking, something was said about an
article on the Nascita written by him and recently published in
<i>L&rsquo;Amico</i>, a Trapanese Sunday newspaper.&nbsp; I knew
nothing about the Nascita, but I knew something about the
avvocato whose acquaintance I had made a few years previously at
the house of my friend Signor Decio D&rsquo;Ali, with whom I had
been dining.&nbsp; After dinner many guests, including the
avvocato Scalisi, came to the house to rehearse a play they were
preparing for a charity performance; they were all amateurs, and
I never saw amateurs act so well.&nbsp; The Signora Decio
D&rsquo;Ali and the Avvocato Scalisi were the best; his was a
comic part, and he did it with so much natural humour that I was
anxious to read his article whatever the Nascita might be, as to
which they gave me some preliminary information.&nbsp; They
reminded me of the Presepio, the representation of <!-- page
116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>the Nativit&agrave; at Bethlehem, which it is the
custom in many places to make at Christmas; there is a most
elaborate one, treated as though the event had happened in modern
times, preserved in the convent of S. Martino, in Naples; there
is one in the Mus&eacute;e de Cluny in Paris,
<i>L&rsquo;Adoration des Rois et des Bergers</i>, Art Napolitain
XVIII si&egrave;cle.&nbsp; I was most familiar with such things
in the chapels on the Sacro Monte at Varallo-Sesia, where the
figures are the size of life.&nbsp; When they saw I had got hold
of the idea, they told me that in Trapani it is the custom in the
homes of the sailors to celebrate the 8th September by making a
representation of the house of S. Joachim as it appeared on the
occasion of the birth of his daughter, the Madonna, and to keep
it on view for three weeks, till S. Michael&rsquo;s day.&nbsp;
They do not do this in any other town, and the avvocato&rsquo;s
article was about one he had seen.</p>
<p>Next morning about 7.30 Ignazio&rsquo;s father most politely
called for me in a carriage and pair and, accompanied by two
other guests, we drove to the house of the bride&rsquo;s family,
where there was a crowd of people, and we were all presented;
then we proceeded to the Municipio, where the civil part of the
marriage was performed; after which we returned to the
bride&rsquo;s house and went through the religious service at an
altar that had been erected in one of the rooms.&nbsp; We admired
the presents and the flowers, partook of refreshments and
exchanged compliments till it was time to go, and I carried away
with me a copy of <i>L&rsquo;Amico</i> given me by the Avvocato
Scalisi, who was one of the guests.</p>
<p>While reading his article I recognised that the little waxen
heads and hands must be part of the raw material for a Nascita,
and in my mind I identified certain figures in the museum which
Conte Pepoli was then arranging in the disused convent of the
Annunziata as remains of old examples of the Nascita and of the
Nativit&agrave;.&nbsp; Nothing would do for it then but I must
see a Nascita, and the difficulty was how to proceed.&nbsp; One
cannot very well go <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>round knocking at all the doors in a
Sicilian town and asking if they have made a Nascita; the
Avvocato Scalisi had gone off to another wedding or to defend a
mafioso, or to transact whatever business falls to the lot of a
Trapanese avvocato.&nbsp; Mario, my coachman, takes no interest
in anything to do with religion in any shape, so he was no use,
and everyone else I spoke to was very kind about it but evidently
did not know how to help me.</p>
<p>I considered what I should do if at Hastings or Grimsby or
Newlyn I wanted to get inside a fisherman&rsquo;s cottage, and it
occurred to me that I should consult the parson.&nbsp; I knew a
priest at Trapani whose acquaintance I had made at Custonaci, but
I did not know where he was.&nbsp; I boldly stopped a couple of
strange priests in the street and asked if they knew my priest;
they did, and one of them took me to his house.&nbsp; It was
rather mean of me to call upon him merely to ask him to help me
to find a Nascita, I ought to have wanted to salute him and enjoy
his company; but he did not appear to think it rude, and we went
together to the old part of the town where the sailors live and
asked at a house where he knew they always used to make a
Nascita, but this year there was none.&nbsp; They told us of
another likely house, but again we were disappointed.&nbsp; We
tried several more without success, and at last I exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lack of faith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my priest replied that that was not the explanation; it
was lack of money, because these things cannot be made for
nothing.</p>
<p>We could not then call at more houses because he was busy with
his own affairs; it was his dinner-time, or he had to go to a
wedding or a funeral or to do whatever it is that Trapanese
priests do in the afternoon, so we postponed our search till the
evening, when he returned with his brother, another priest, who
knew a family who had made a Nascita, and we went to their
house.</p>
<p>We were shown into a large room, at the end of which, on <!--
page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>a long table, was a sort of rabbit hutch or
doll&rsquo;s house, all on one floor, about eighteen inches high,
with the front off showing that it was divided into eight square
compartments, so that the whole hutch was about twelve feet long,
the width of the room.&nbsp; These compartments were the rooms of
Joachim&rsquo;s house or flat, as we should say, and the figures
in them were about eight inches high.&nbsp; In the arts actual
size counts for little and, as with the marionettes, I soon
accepted the dolls as representatives of men and women and felt
as though I were present at some such family festival as
Ignazio&rsquo;s wedding, and the rooms, all leading one into the
other, contributed to the illusion.</p>
<p>We were asked to begin with the entrance.&nbsp; The front part
of it had been let to a cobbler who was sitting at his bench
mending a shoe, and if it had been real life he would have been
singing.&nbsp; Behind him was a garden of artificial flowers with
a fountain of real water that was not playing that evening.&nbsp;
A door led through the side wall into the second compartment,
which was a salone.&nbsp; The porter, in evening dress, was
introducing a married couple, also in evening dress, who had been
invited and were accompanied by their baby in the arms of the
wet-nurse.&nbsp; This compartment was divided by a partition with
an open door through which one saw an alcove, or back room, with
a buffet loaded with sweets, cakes, and ices, at which the guests
were to refresh themselves as they passed.&nbsp; At
Ignazio&rsquo;s wedding footmen carried the refreshments about on
trays.&nbsp; A door in the side led to the third compartment,
where children were dancing to a toy piano with four real
notes.&nbsp; I struck one and it sounded.&nbsp; A lady doll was
playing, and I looked at her music, but the notes were too small
for my eyes, so I asked our hostess what music it was, and she
replied that it was a selection from the <i>Geisha</i>.&nbsp; I
remembered then that there had recently been in the town a
travelling opera company performing that work which is so popular
in Italy that one often hears <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>the boys
whistling the airs in the streets.&nbsp; A surname is not of much
practical use in Sicily, and some of my friends have not mastered
mine, but by those who know it, and who also know that it is the
same as that of the composer of the <i>Geisha</i>, I have
sometimes been credited with the music of his opera, a compliment
which it distresses me to be compelled to decline.&nbsp; In the
alcove behind were musicians playing guitars.&nbsp; I did not
strike a note on a guitar, feeling sure that it would be out of
tune with the piano.</p>
<p>A door in the side wall led to the fourth room, where S.
Joachim was entertaining four kings who wore their crowns.&nbsp;
These kings have nothing to do with Gaspare, Melchiorre, and
Baldassare, who fall down and worship the infant Jesus, opening
their treasures and presenting unto him gifts, gold and
frankincense and myrrh, on the occasion of the
Nativit&agrave;.&nbsp; Those three were led from the East to the
manger at Bethlehem by the miraculous star; these in
Joachim&rsquo;s room came in response to the usual cards of
invitation sent by the family, just as the relations and guests
came to Ignazio&rsquo;s wedding.&nbsp; The Madonna had, I think
my priest told me, forty kings and sixty condottieri in her
pedigree.&nbsp; Invitations had been issued to all their
descendants, and no doubt all had accepted, but, owing to want of
means on the part of the artist who made this Nascita and want of
space in the rabbit hutch, only four kings could be shown.&nbsp;
It is not everyone who can entertain so many as four kings; there
were none at Ignazio&rsquo;s wedding.&nbsp; In this room there
was also a monsignore with red buttons to his sottana, he had an
attendant who, my priest told me, was a seminarista.&nbsp; In the
alcove behind was Joachim&rsquo;s bed, and the empty cup from
which he had drunk his morning black coffee stood on the table by
his bedside.</p>
<p>The door leading to the fifth room was partly concealed by a
notice with these words: &ldquo;&Egrave; Nata Maria,&rdquo; and,
accordingly, here we found the new-born child in an elaborate
<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>cradle attended by three angels who were planted on the
floor in front of her, rather a Christmas-cardy group.&nbsp; Four
queens with crowns had come, no doubt they were the wives of
Joachim&rsquo;s kings, and there was a Jewish priest whom I took
to be Simeon, he had a head-covering with horns such as Caiaphas
wears at Varallo.&nbsp; My priest, however, assured me that
Simeon was not a priest, he was only &ldquo;un uomo
qualunque&rdquo;; and he would have it that the figure
represented Melchizedek.&nbsp; This occasion must not be confused
with a subsequent one when the <i>Nunc Dimittis</i> was
improvised by Simeon, who, he said, could not have lived long
enough to be present on both occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reverend Father,&rdquo; I objected, &ldquo;pardon me if
I give you an example which points in the other direction.&nbsp;
The best man or, as you would say, the compare at my
grandfather&rsquo;s wedding not only lived to perform the
ceremony of marrying my father and mother, but lived long enough
also to marry my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest wavered, but was not convinced; he repeated that
this was Melchizedek and that he always appears at the birth of
the Madonna, and I was so much under the spell of the Nascita
that I could not remember precisely when Melchizedek lived.&nbsp;
Whoever this personage was, he had passed into this room from
Joachim&rsquo;s room on the day of the Sacred Name of Maria, that
is on the Sunday after the birth, and he had officiated at the
baptism.&nbsp; On the floor was a bath of water with cinnamon, in
which the baby had been washed and with which the guests were to
cross themselves.&nbsp; S. Anna was in her bedroom in the alcove
behind, but not in bed, she got up and sat in a chair on the
ninth day after the birth.</p>
<p>Through the door in the side the guests were to pass to the
sixth room, where there were nuns engaged in household duties,
mending the linen, darning the stockings, and so on.&nbsp; One
was working a sewing-machine, and in the alcove behind was their
bedroom.</p>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>The side door led to the seventh room, where there was
another nun ironing and directing the servants who were making
quince marmalade and extract of pomidoro and discharging similar
autumnal duties; behind was the servants&rsquo; bedroom.</p>
<p>Lastly we came to the eighth room, which, like the front
entrance, filled the whole compartment and had no alcove.&nbsp;
This was the kitchen and dining-room in one.&nbsp; The hospitable
board was spread with such profusion that there was not room on
it for another egg-cup.&nbsp; Here Joachim was to entertain the
kings and queens to dinner later on.&nbsp; Three Turks and one
female servant were controlling affairs, making the cuscuso and
preparing the maccaroni.&nbsp; There were young chickens in a
corner; I inquired for their mother, and was told she was busy
making the soup; then I saw that a saucepan was simmering on the
stove.&nbsp; The walls were hung with brightly polished copper
cooking utensils and there were baskets of maccaroni on the
floor.</p>
<p>The three principal rooms were carpeted with tissue-paper
advertisements of a new bar in the Via Torrearsa which has lately
been opened by relations of our host.&nbsp; Each room was lighted
by a naked candle kept in place upon the floor by a drop of
wax.&nbsp; All the walls were hung with wall-papers, originally
designed for larger apartments, and adorned with pictures, among
which I observed Carlo Dolci&rsquo;s <i>Ecce Homo</i>.&nbsp; The
Avvocato Scalisi saw, or says he saw, two saints flanking an
advertisement of cod-liver oil, and in Joachim&rsquo;s room was a
portrait of Pope Pius X blessing the company which included
besides the kings a couple of officers in uniform.&nbsp; But then
the Avvocato Scalisi is a humorist, and the trouble with
humorists is that they are too fond of assuming all their readers
to be humorists also, whereas they sometimes have a reader of
another kind who is puzzled to know whether what they say is to
be taken seriously or not.</p>
<p>We were about to make our compliments preliminary to
departure, when our host produced a tray with marsala <!-- page
122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>and biscuits, so we sat down for a few minutes and I
observed what I took to be a little waxen paladin among the
wine-glasses.&nbsp; He was, however, no paladin, though he wore
armour and a helmet; he was S. Michele waiting to arrive on his
festa, the 29th September.&nbsp; It was now the 20th and, partly
to please me and partly because it did not much matter for a day
or two, he arrived at once.&nbsp; He had wings, but they wanted
repairing, so I carried him carefully from the tray and deposited
him in the corner of the room in which the baby lay.</p>
<p>My priest found several other examples of the Nascita and took
me to see them before I left Trapani.&nbsp; The differences were
slight; in one case there were only three rooms; in another the
rooms were divided so as to vary in size; in another the rooms
had windows at the back with balconies.&nbsp; Sometimes the
guests were reading the <i>Giornale di Sicilia</i>, and I saw
opera-glasses on the table in one room and in another the
gentlemen had deposited their tall hats on the sofa.&nbsp; There
were book-cases full of books and the bedrooms were furnished
down to the most insignificant but necessary details.&nbsp; S.
Joachim in one of the houses was entertaining only three friends,
and they had no kingly marks upon them; they were perhaps
descendants of the condottieri.&nbsp; I thought afterwards of
going back to inquire, but one cannot very well return to a house
where one has seen a Nascita and ask to be allowed to look again
to make sure whether or not the guests have hung up their crowns
on the hat pegs of the umbrella-stand at the front
entrance.&nbsp; There was something about these gentlemen,
something in their costume as they sat at a round table with S.
Joachim, a queer 1830 feeling that put me in mind of Mr. Pickwick
and his three friends sitting in their private room at the
&ldquo;George and Vulture,&rdquo; George Yard, Lombard Street,
except that they were only drinking coffee.</p>
<p>In the garden at the entrance to one house was a baby taking
the air in a perambulator and a band of eight <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>musicians
with a conductor.&nbsp; There was real water with a tap and a
basin in the kitchen so that the guests might wash their hands
after dinner.&nbsp; There was a mouse-trap in the corner of the
kitchen.&nbsp; In one room the guests were playing cards, in
another eating ices, and I observed a toy piano with the extended
compass of six notes.</p>
<p>In all the kitchens there was a Turk for the cuscuso.&nbsp; It
is made with fish, semolina, and onions in a double saucepan
which in England is called a steamer.&nbsp; In the bottom part
water is boiled; in the top part, over the holes, they put a
layer of chopped onions, and over that the semolina which has
been previously made into very small balls by damping it.&nbsp;
The onions prevent the semolina from falling through the holes
into the water, and the steam of the water coming through cooks
the semolina and the onions.&nbsp; The fish are put into the
water at the right moment and are boiled while the semolina is
being steamed.&nbsp; It is all served together like
bouillabaisse, the semolina answering to the bread, and extract
of pomidoro is added.&nbsp; One would not be likely to meet with
cuscuso in the houses of the well-to-do; one might get it in the
albergo by insisting on it, but they would rather not provide it
because, like the Discobolus in Butler&rsquo;s poem <i>A Psalm of
Montreal</i>, it is vulgar.&nbsp; I have eaten it only once when
I dined with my compare Michele Lombardo, a jeweller, to whose
son I stood as padrino at his cresima, and I do not care to eat
it again, not because it is vulgar, but because I did not find it
nearly so good as bouillabaisse.&nbsp; The recipe for it has
penetrated to Trapani from Africa as a result of the constant
intercourse between Sicily and the French colony of Tunis, the
fishermen of Trapani going over to the African coast not only for
fish, but also for coral and for sponges.</p>
<p>My priest was inclined to treat the Nascita with tolerant
contempt; he muttered the word &ldquo;Anacronismo&rdquo; several
times and, since I have ascertained that Melchizedek was a
contemporary of Abraham, I think he should not <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>have done
so.&nbsp; I said that the anachronisms did not disturb me.&nbsp;
I told him that in the marionette theatre in Palermo, when
Cristoforo Colombo embarks from the port of Palos in Spain to
discover America, a sailor, sitting on the paddle-box of the
piroscafo, the steamboat, sings that Neapolitan song <i>Santa
Lucia</i>.&nbsp; I passed over the anticipation of steam and
contented myself with asking the buffo whether the song had been
composed so long ago and also whether its popularity had extended
from Naples into Spain.&nbsp; He replied that it had extended to
Palermo and that his audience connected it in their minds with
the sea, and as for the date of its composition he had made no
inquiries, but he knew it was older than &ldquo;O Sole
Mio&rdquo;; we do not go to the arts for accurate
arch&aelig;ological details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make you a paragon,&rdquo; said the buffo.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I was returning from Catania I looked out of the side
windows of the train and saw that the telegraph posts, as we
passed by, were some distance apart.&nbsp; But I made friends
with the guard, who took me into his van, and when I looked at
them again out of the back window of the train they seemed to get
closer and closer together in the distance until, far away, there
appeared to be no space between them; but I knew that there was
always the same space between them.&nbsp; So it is with the
centuries, when they are in the distant past it is difficult to
distinguish in what century any particular event happened.&nbsp;
History may settle such points, but the arts come to us from a
country of the imagination whose laws of time and space are not
as our laws.&nbsp; Art is trying to get the people to realise
that a thing happened, not to teach them precisely
when.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I quoted this to my priest, and he admitted its justice; also
he was so polite as to waive his objection about anacronismo,
which, I then saw, had only been started in consideration of my
being a professor; not that I am really a professor but he had
introduced me to our host as one, and I had accepted the
distinction so as to avoid the dreary explanation that would have
been forced upon me after <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>a
disclaimer.&nbsp; He having waived his anacronismo so generously,
it was now my turn to trump up an objection which I could deal
with afterwards as circumstances might require.&nbsp; In making
my choice I did not forget his cloth and, imitating as well as I
could his tone of tolerant contempt, muttered the word
&ldquo;Irriverenza&rdquo; several times.&nbsp; He saw what I
meant at once and, in his reply, somewhat followed my lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;is the irreverence in
making S. Joachim&rsquo;s friends arrive in tall hats and dress
clothes?&nbsp; Why should they not read the <i>Giornale di
Sicilia</i> and play cards?&nbsp; Where is the irreverence in
making the children celebrate his daughter&rsquo;s birth by
dancing to a piano?&nbsp; Why should not the Madonna have her
baby-linen made on an American sewing-machine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he took this line so decidedly and we had given up the
anacronismo, I gave up the irreverence at once and agreed with
him that there is no reason against any of these things being
done if it helps the spectators.&nbsp; The arts are concerned
more with faith than with reason, more with the spirit than with
the flesh, more with truth than with fact, and we can never get
away from the intention of the artist.&nbsp; Even in that Art of
Arts which we call Life, our judgment must always be influenced
by the spirit in which we believe that a thing is done.&nbsp; I
have read somewhere that one coachman will flick flies off his
horse with the intention of worrying the flies, while another
(Mario, for instance) does the same thing with the intention of
relieving the horse.&nbsp; When a modern Frenchman in the spirit
of the <i>Scenes de la Vie de Boheme</i> paints the guests in
modern evening dress at a <i>Marriage in Cana of Galilee</i> we
are offended.&nbsp; The Nascita is not done by such an artist; it
is peculiarly a woman&rsquo;s subject, being a picture of home
life with a birth for its occasion, and is usually made by a girl
who has never heard of Bohemia.&nbsp; She has seen trains in the
railway station and ships in the port, but probably has never
herself travelled in either.&nbsp; Her father or her brother <!--
page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>has perhaps been fishing for sponges off Sfax and may
have returned with stories of the wonders of Tunis, and so she
may have heard of a boulevard, but she is not affected by
it.&nbsp; She makes her Nascita as the medieval painters made
their pictures, and is not seeking to attract attention or to
astonish or to advertise herself or to make money.&nbsp;
Sicilians are all artists, and the Nascita is the girl&rsquo;s
pretext for making as close a representation as she can of the
life to which she and her friends are accustomed.&nbsp; It is for
her what the Shield of Achilles was for Homer, what the Falstaff
scenes in <i>King Henry IV</i> were for Shakespeare, or what the
Escape from Paris was for my buffo in Palermo.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />
THE COMPARE</h3>
<p>Michele Lombardo, a goldsmith of Trapani, came to me one day
and said he wished me to be his compare.&nbsp; I at once had a
vision of myself as a black man riding round a circus on a
bare-backed horse and jumping through hoops.&nbsp; That was
because, at the time, all my knowledge about a compare was
derived from a conversation I had had in the house of the Greco
family at Palermo.&nbsp; Among the photographs grouped on the
wall was one of a pleasant-looking nigger in European
costume.&nbsp; I asked who he was, and Carolina said he was an
African, a compare.&nbsp; I asked what she meant and she said
that her father had held the African&rsquo;s niece at its
cresima.&nbsp; The African&rsquo;s name was Emanuele, but she had
never known his family name.&nbsp; I asked whether he had a
profession and she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faceva cavallerizza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew no more about cavallerizza than about a compare or a
cresima.&nbsp; She explained the first by saying that the horse
goes round and Emanuele on the horse&rsquo;s back performs
gymnastics.&nbsp; That is, he used to do so, but he went to
Paris, where a duchess saw him performing and, on account of his
agility and his attractive physiognomy, fell in love with
him.&nbsp; She was an Egyptian duchess and wore diamonds because
she was rich.&nbsp; She was so rich she could do as she liked in
other respects besides diamonds, and, liking to marry Emanuele,
she did so and made him padrone of a grand hotel in Madrid or
Vienna, I forget which, but it was a hotel of the first class,
frequented by Russian princesses and American millionaires.</p>
<p>I told Michele about this and he assured me that his <!-- page
130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>proposal concealed no equestrian circus and no Egyptian
duchess; to become his compare I should only have to hold his
eldest son Pietro, aged seven, at his cresima.&nbsp; Here was an
opportunity of solving the mysteries of the cresima and the
compare, which Michele, who took my consent for granted, assured
me would solve themselves as we proceeded.&nbsp; We went to the
bishop&rsquo;s palace and were shown into his private chapel,
where the sagrestano entertained us with conversation while we
waited.&nbsp; Only once before had he ever approached an
Englishman, and that was at Messina.&nbsp; He was a very rich
Englishman and a devout son of the Church; his card with his name
and address was still preserved as a ricordo in the
sagrestano&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; This gentleman afterwards died in
Naples under dramatic circumstances.&nbsp; He had stepped out one
evening to take a mouthful of air, and on returning went upstairs
to his room; as he put his latch-key into the door he fell down
dead.&nbsp; By his will, which was found in the drawer of his
writing-table, he bequeathed all his great wealth to the church
of S. Antonio.&nbsp; I wanted to know whether this church is in
Messina, or Naples, or England; or, it might be in America or
Australia, for they sometimes speak of an Inglese Americano and
of an Inglese Australiano.&nbsp; Once I took some of my
superfluous luggage to a forwarding agent in Palermo to have it
sent to England by piccola velocit&agrave;.&nbsp; It included a
figure of Buddha which I had bought in a curiosity-shop in
Malta.&nbsp; The clerk declined to forward the image because it
was a product of art, and such things may not be sent out of
Italy.&nbsp; I said it was a product of religion; he accepted my
correction and proposed to describe it in the form he was filling
up as a Madonna.&nbsp; Again I objected, pointing out that anyone
could see it was not a lady; it was Buddha.&nbsp; He was as
puzzled as I had been over the compare.&nbsp; I attempted a short
sketch from memory of Buddha&rsquo;s life and works, and was so
far successful that the figure travelled to London as a Cristo
Indiano.</p>
<p>The arrival of the bishop cut short the sagrestano&rsquo;s
<!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>reminiscences.&nbsp; There also came a woman with a
baby in arms who was to receive its cresima at once, in case it
might not live to reach Pietro&rsquo;s discreet age of
seven.&nbsp; The bishop in magnificent vestments of brocade and
gold stood with his back to the altar; the woman with the baby
knelt before him to his right and the sagrestano put his hand on
the baby&rsquo;s shoulder; Pietro knelt to the bishop&rsquo;s
left and I put my hand on his shoulder.&nbsp; The ceremony, it
seems, is a partial repetition of the baptism, or a performance
of a part omitted from the baptism, or it is an addition to the
baptism&mdash;for I did not understand so fully as Michele said I
should.&nbsp; Unless accelerated, as in the case of the baby, it
takes place when the child is old enough to have mastered the
more elementary teaching of the Church but does not yet
understand enough to be confirmed; and it consists in the
bishop&rsquo;s using a great many words and gestures and making
the sign of the Cross in oil on the child&rsquo;s forehead.&nbsp;
Almost before the oil was on, the sagrestano wiped it off with
cotton-wool and the bishop, after cleaning his thumb with half a
lemon which the sagrestano had thoughtfully placed on the altar,
held out his ring to be kissed by the woman and by Pietro.</p>
<p>In this way I became compare of Michele Lombardo and padrino
of Pietro, who is my figlioccio.&nbsp; Being Michele&rsquo;s
compare I am in a way related to all the family and, when I
arrive at Trapani, Michele brings as many of his children as he
can gather to salute me.&nbsp; Last time he brought five and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse my not bringing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In calling Emanuele her compare, Carolina Greco was not
speaking very strictly; the relationship exists between her
father and Emanuele&rsquo;s brother, whose child he held; but
family relationships are so close in Sicily, and they speak so
loosely about them, that a compare of one member of a family may
be said to be compare of them all.</p>
<p>A compare is, however, primarily he who holds a child at its
baptism, and this, no doubt, is why S. Giovanni Battista <!--
page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>is padrone of compari.&nbsp; Thus I am Compare di
Battesimo of Peppino and Brancaccia at Castellinaria.&nbsp; It
was the grandfather who actually held Ricuzzu at the baptism, but
he did it as my deputy, and the spiritual relationship of compare
which exists between Peppino and myself is closer than that of
padrino and figlioccio which exists between Ricuzzu and
myself.</p>
<p>The first step in establishing the relationship of Compare di
Battesimo is usually taken at the wedding of the parents, when he
who holds the cup or tazza containing the ring becomes Compare di
Anello of the bride and bridegroom and also receives the
privilege, or undertakes the obligation, of holding the first
baby at its baptism.&nbsp; At Ignazio&rsquo;s wedding someone
held the tazza with the ring and handed it to the priest at the
right moment, but I did not see this done because between the
happy couple and myself the lady-guests interposed a forest of
hats, but I saw the tazza among the wedding presents and thought
it was an ash-tray till one of them corrected me.&nbsp; There
must have been a Compare di Anello also at the wedding of S.
Joachim and S. Anna, and this person, whoever he was, ought to
have appeared, and perhaps did appear, in the Nascita as padrino
of the Madonna at her baptism, but I did not visit a Nascita on
the Day of the Sacred Name of Maria, so I did not see the
baptism.</p>
<p>A fourth kind of compare is the Compare di Parentela; the name
is used for those relationships by marriage which have no special
name.&nbsp; The brother-in-law, for instance, though he may be a
compare is not necessarily one, he is a cognato; but the parents
of a husband and the parents of his wife are compari to one
another, and the husband&rsquo;s cugino, or cousin, is compare of
the wife and so on.</p>
<p>There is yet a fifth kind&mdash;the Compare di San
Giovanni.&nbsp; The first time I saw Turiddu Balistrieri after
his escape from the earthquake at Messina (see Chapter XVII post)
it seemed an occasion proper to be solemnised in some way, and we
determined to become compari to one another, but <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>as
there was no wedding and no baptism or cresima we did not know
how to proceed.&nbsp; We consulted an expert in Catania, Peppino
Fazio, who said it was an exceptional case.&nbsp; This did not
alarm us because exceptional cases are treated tenderly in
Sicily.&nbsp; Our expert took time to consider and in a day or
two gave his opinion:&mdash;The relationship could be established
by our going into the country on the 24th June, the day of S.
Giovanni, and exchanging cucumbers or pots of basil.&nbsp;
Nothing could be simpler, and accordingly on the 24th of June,
1910, Turiddu and I went into the country.&nbsp; He was in
Catania, so he spent the day on the slopes of Etna.&nbsp; I was
staying with friends at Bath, so I went for a walk on
Lansdown.&nbsp; In choosing our tokens we had regard to the
arrangements of the postal union; he sent me a few dried leaves
of basil and an elaborate drawing of an emerald-green plant in a
gamboge pot tied round with a vermilion ribbon as a sign of
goodwill and friendship.&nbsp; He drew the design out of his own
imagination and coloured it with paints which we had bought
together in Naples.&nbsp; I might have sent him a volume of Keats
containing a <i>Pot of Basil</i> in an equally transmissible
form, but as he does not read English he would not have
understood; so I sent him a young cucumber about three inches
long.&nbsp; The ceremony was complete, and we are as good a pair
of compari as any in the island.</p>
<p>Thus there are five kinds of compari, namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Compare di Battesimo.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Compare di Cresima.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Compare di Anello.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Compare di Parentela.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Compare di San Giovanni.</p>
<p>It may be said that there are more kinds; the woman who washes
the cap in which a baby is baptised becomes comare, but I do not
know whether this is so anywhere but in Catania.&nbsp; And the
word is sometimes used in a figurative sense as a term of
endearment in addressing a partner or any <!-- page 134--><a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>intimate
friend, and sometimes with the intention of inspiring confidence
in addressing a stranger in a lower station of life.&nbsp; When
two plump gentlemen and one thin one entered the yard of the
&ldquo;White Hart&rdquo; where Mr. Samuel Weller happened to be
burnishing a pair of painted tops, the thin gentleman
advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the thin gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one o&rsquo; the adwice gratis
order,&rdquo; thought Sam, &ldquo;or you wouldn&rsquo;t be so
wery fond of me all at once.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he only said,
&ldquo;Well, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Sicilian Mr. Perker might have said, &ldquo;Compare&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;Amico,&rdquo; and one is expected to believe
that no unworthy suspicion would have crossed the mind of a
Sicilian Sam Weller.</p>
<p>Between compari there is such complete trust and devotion that
no request is ever refused; there is also the conviction, based
first on intuition and afterwards on experience, that no request
which ought to be refused will ever be made&mdash;a conviction
which is, I suppose, an element in all friendship.&nbsp; A
compare is received in the house as a member of the family and is
looked upon as a relation closer than a brother.&nbsp; One can
choose as compare a friend in whom one has confidence, whereas
there is no choosing a brother, and cases have been known in
which brothers did not agree.&nbsp; But any compare taking
advantage of his position would be a contemptible traitor and
among the sulphur-miners would provide material for a play at the
Teatro Machiavelli.&nbsp; Talking it over with Peppino Pampalone
he told me that sometimes things do go wrong, so that they say
there are three relations more dangerous than enemies&mdash;the
cognato (the brother-in-law) the cugino (the cousin), and the
compare.&nbsp; And they say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dagli amici mi guardi Iddio<br />
Ch&egrave; dai nemici mi guardo io.</p>
<p>May God protect me from my friends<br />
For I can protect myself from my enemies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>Peppino says: &ldquo;If it is the man that would robber
you in the street, this man would put his life in danger because
every movement of this man you are looking.&nbsp; But if it is a
friend then is it other; then you are depending in him that he is
coming to salvare you, you are embracing him, kissing him,
don&rsquo;t be regarding the revolver that shall be in his pocket
and sometimes would kill you.&nbsp; If it would not be Bruto, he
would not succeed to take the life of Cesare.&nbsp; Did you
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But these are exceptional cases.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
COMPARE BERTO</h3>
<p>In 1901 I spent ten days on Mount Eryx, now usually called
Monte San Giuliano, near Trapani, where I went to see the
nocturnal procession of <i>Noah&rsquo;s Ark and the Universal
Deluge</i> (<i>Diversions in Sicily</i>, Chapter X).&nbsp; During
those days I made the acquaintance of about twenty young men of
whom Alberto Augugliaro, the son of the professor of mathematics
in the Ginnasio, was the chief.&nbsp; I have seen him nearly
every year since, first as a student at Trapani, then at the
University of Palermo, and again when he was at home on the
Mountain for the holidays, in villeggiatura, or doing the
practical work for his diploma in the chemist&rsquo;s shop of his
uncle.&nbsp; When he became qualified, his uncle handed the shop
over to him and he is now established in it.</p>
<p>One starry September evening in 1909 we were walking together
in the balio (the garden on the top of the Mountain), and I asked
whether, as he was now over thirty, it was not time for him to
think of getting married.&nbsp; He confessed that negotiations
were in progress.&nbsp; I inquired the lady&rsquo;s name, and he
came close to me, took my arm and whispered a word in my
ear.&nbsp; If he had shouted the <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>word it
would have reached no other ear but mine.&nbsp; We were alone
upon the Mountain; the Ericini were sleeping within their walls
of stone; over their tiled and terraced roofs the stars were
pacing through the night; in front of us and to our right and
left, far below, encircled by its mountainous amphitheatre, the
spacious plain was cooling after the heat of yesterday; behind
us, the sea was drowsily patting the shore round the foot of
Monte Cofano and along by happy Bonagia, swaying idly in and out
of the harbours of Trapani and among the islands&mdash;Levanzo,
Favognana, and distant Marettimo.&nbsp; Berto need not have
whispered the word; but it was a secret&mdash;it was the name of
his lady.</p>
<p>Soon after Christmas he announced in the most open manner,
that is to say on a post-card, that the preliminaries were over
and that his engagement to Giuseppina had been made public; I
sent congratulations to them both and he replied in a letter
which, omitting the formalities, runs thus in English:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, on my part, and Giuseppina, on hers, are
extremely contented because we both love you with that love which
is strong and powerful enough to raise the heart and to transport
us above the breathable air; and, as our thoughts frequently fly
to you, our distant English friend, we make you a proposition,
but you will understand that we lay no obligation upon you and we
do not ask you to take any trouble.&nbsp; Here it is in two
words: It is our most vivid desire that you should become our
compare: that is, that you should hold the tazza containing the
ring at our wedding.&nbsp; I repeat, it is our most vivid desire
that you will accede to our request for this honour and we shall
be most grateful to you if you will content us.&nbsp; It is for
you to send your answer which we await with anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I cannot be more dear to Berto than he is to me&mdash;I
am not sure about the breathable air, but he is one of the best
fellows I know&mdash;so I wrote saying I was more flattered,
honoured, and pleased by his request than I could express <!--
page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>in words.&nbsp; Moreover, it fell out very conveniently
because the ceremony was to take place in the following April at
a time when I intended to be in Sicily.&nbsp; Then came the
difficulty about the wedding present, and whether there was any
special duty for a compare to perform besides holding the
ring.&nbsp; I remembered Ignazio&rsquo;s ash-tray and asked
whether perhaps I ought to bring something of the kind from
London.&nbsp; Berto replied that the tazza is a sacred object
belonging to the church and is lent for the ceremony and, as I
did not seem to know much about it, he kindly informed me that
the customs of his country on the occasion of a wedding are as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The father and the mother of the bridegroom and
the father and the mother of the bride invite the relations and
friends, who all offer presents of greater or less value
according to the degree of relationship and friendship.&nbsp; The
ring is chosen by the bridegroom in consultation with the
bride.&nbsp; The compare, of his own accord, offers a present to
the couple, more usually he offers it only to the bride.</p>
<p>All this I have told you merely as information with regard to
the customs of my country; it is not necessary for you to give
any present but, if you wish to do so, do as you wish.&nbsp;
Wedding presents are lifelong records of relationship and of
friendship.</p>
<p>If I am to speak frankly, loyally and sincerely to you as the
friend I have always been to you, I recommend you to bring some
present for the bride because, as you who have travelled so much
must know, in small places not to receive a present from the
compare would be to provoke the remark among all who talk that
the bride and bridegroom were not complimented by the
compare.&nbsp; I tell you this because you are my dearest friend
and not because I wish to be critical.&nbsp; Bring anything you
choose and be sure that whatever may be offered by you will be
accepted by my bride.&nbsp; For me&mdash;nothing.&nbsp; I have
sufficient in the thought and the comfort of your friendship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I consulted my sister, who recommended me to visit a
jeweller&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; There is one in Regent Street where
I <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>take my sleeve-links to be repaired when I have the
misfortune to break them.&nbsp; She approved and I went and
explained the situation to the young man, who was very kind about
it and, after a few false starts, cordially advised one of a line
of gold pendants much in vogue to be worn with a light
chain.&nbsp; He had an apparently inexhaustible stock, and I
became as confused and helpless as when some change is necessary
in my spectacles and the oculist wants to know whether I see
better with this or with that.&nbsp; I have no idea how long I
was there, but in the end I selected a meaningless object of a
design which the young man assured me was original and exclusive,
and which I hoped would appear fairly unobjectionable to the
recipient.&nbsp; After which, not being at all content to leave
Berto resting solely on the thought and comfort of my friendship,
I chose for him a dozen silver teaspoons.&nbsp; My sister, to
whom I showed these articles, approved and, of her own unprompted
generosity, added a piece of Irish lace as a special gift from
herself to the bride, though she is unacquainted with any of the
family except from my description.&nbsp; Thus loaded I travelled
to Trapani and went up the Mountain in the public automobile,
arriving on a Thursday morning early in April, 1910, the wedding
being fixed for the following Saturday.</p>
<p>Berto met me at the Trapani gate of the town and took me to
the Albergo Sicilia, where I had stayed when I was on the
Mountain in 1901.&nbsp; Signor Bosco has died since, and his
widow keeps on the inn with the help of some members of her
family of six daughters and four sons.&nbsp; One of these sons is
Peppi, a blacksmith, who plays a trombone in the municipal
band.&nbsp; Another is Alberto, one of the chauffeurs who drive
the automobile up and down the Mountain.&nbsp; Alberto and one of
his sisters appeared as children in the procession of the
<i>Universal Deluge</i>.&nbsp; They were sitting at the feet of
Sin and holding one another&rsquo;s hands to represent the wicked
population destined to destruction.&nbsp; Alberto is now
married.&nbsp; His wedding took place in the morning, and at
three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon three hundred guests <!--
page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>were entertained at dinner in the Albergo Sicilia,
after which they danced till dawn and, as the wedding was in
December, they must have been rather tired; but it was an
exceptional case.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Berto came for me and took me to the house of
his bride to pay my respects.&nbsp; The house belongs to her; she
has two brothers and a sister all married and settled, and on
Berto&rsquo;s marriage he will leave the house of his parents and
go and live in his wife&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; We entered through a
door that led through a high blank wall into a courtyard where
there were flowering plants in pots, and steps leading up to the
living-rooms on the first floor over a basement which is used
partly as stabling and partly as storage.&nbsp; This is the form
of most of the houses on the Mountain, and the blank wall and
courtyard give them an air of seclusion.&nbsp; We went up the
steps and were received by the bride and many of her relations,
some of whom I had already met, for Giuseppina is a cousin of
Berto&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; They showed me over the house; the
rooms all led into one another and, though they were not in a
row, it was rather like going over S. Joachim&rsquo;s house when
it is being prepared for the family festa of the Nascita.&nbsp;
It would have been still more like it if we had come in by the
other front door, for the side we entered is on a street that
goes up-hill and the house is at a corner with another front door
in the other street at the top of the hill and level with the
living-rooms.&nbsp; This other front door leads straight into a
hall, which will be occupied by the musicians on the evening of
the wedding, from this one passes to the dining-room where the
servants are to dance, then to the salone where the guests are to
dance.</p>
<p>We sat in the salone, about twenty of us in a circle, talking
the usual talk, and one of the young ladies asked me whether we
had compari at an English wedding.&nbsp; I said we had something
of the kind.&nbsp; She inquired what I should be called if I were
compare at an English wedding, and, seeing no way out of it, I
modestly murmured:</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;In England I should be called the Best
Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This naturally led to a torrent of compliments, which I
battled with for some moments, and finally subdued by asking to
see the rest of the house.&nbsp; We went to the room which had
been arranged as the buffet; the walls were adorned with large
looking-glasses, and in the middle was a table for the cakes and
sweets.&nbsp; The buffet is to be my bedroom next time I come to
the Mountain.&nbsp; We passed through two other saloni and then
inspected two bedrooms, one for the happy couple, the other for
Berto&rsquo;s mother, who is to stay with them for the first few
days.&nbsp; The presents were arranged on a table by the side of
the nuptial couch, which had arrived that morning from Palermo
together with the rest of the bedroom suite, very handsome, and
made of Hungarian ash.&nbsp; The presents were rather as I have
seen wedding presents in England, plenty of spoons and forks,
gold brooches, rings, bracelets, some set with diamonds and some
with other stones, and I was glad I was not really back in Regent
Street choosing my pendant.</p>
<p>We went into the courtyard and into the stable where we saw
Mille-lire the donkey, who is scarcely bigger than a Saint
Bernard dog and only cost thirty-five lire.&nbsp; It was Berto
who gave him the name of Mille-lire to signify that his value far
exceeds his price.&nbsp; He has a cart to match and can take four
people, but I think they must be rather small people.&nbsp; He
shares his stable with thirty-eight chickens, old and young, and
two ducks, who all come out into the courtyard to be fed in the
sun.&nbsp; There are also three pigeons, making a total of
forty-four creatures.&nbsp; In addition there are two cats who
live in the house and two tortoises who live in the
courtyard.&nbsp; Tortoises are found wild among the rocks in the
mountains and the peasants bring them up to the town and sell
them.&nbsp; These came from Monte Asp&aacute;racio, which is near
Cofano; they cost forty centimes each, and bring good luck to the
house.&nbsp; On Mount Eryx there is a convent of nuns of S.
Teresa, to <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>whom flesh is forbidden, but the
prohibition does not extend to tortoises, which the nuns eat with
tomato sauce.&nbsp; When the nuns begin to feel the infirmities
of age they are no longer limited to this strange meat, the
prohibition is withdrawn, and they live like other old ladies,
eating what they choose.&nbsp; I have no idea how many fourpenny
tortoises would make a meal for a healthy young nun on Monte San
Giuliano, where one&rsquo;s appetite is sharpened by the
air.&nbsp; They occasionally add a few snails, which are also
permitted; there is a kind of snail which is found underground
and is considered a luxury by others besides the nuns of S.
Teresa.</p>
<p>After the stable and the courtyard we went to the terrace
whence, over the roofs and cupolas and among the towers and
belfries of the town, there is a view of the sea and the
plain.&nbsp; Then we visited the kitchen and saw the oven for
baking the bread.&nbsp; All the well-to-do families on the
Mountain possess land on the campagna where they grow their own
corn; they take it to the mill to be weighed and ground, and
fetch back the flour which is also weighed; they know that if
they leave a hundred kilograms of grain they must receive
ninety-nine of flour, and in this wasted kilogram of flour lurks
the true reason why the miller wears a white hat.&nbsp; They bake
their own bread and sometimes make their own maccaroni at
home.&nbsp; They grow their own grapes and make their own
wine.&nbsp; They have olive trees for oil, and goats whose milk
they drink, considering it lighter and more digestible than
cows&rsquo; milk.&nbsp; Berto&rsquo;s sister has a private goat
of her own, who lives down in the country and comes up every
morning, a journey of three-quarters of an hour, and she milks it
herself.&nbsp; Thus they pass their lives very close to Mother
Earth, and the seasons sensibly affect their comfort.&nbsp; They
have little use for money except to buy coffee, fish, sugar,
meat, and clothes, or the stuff of which they make their clothes,
and some of them raise their own linen and wool.&nbsp; But they
want money when there is a family festa; Berto <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>told me he
had spent 700 lire merely for the sweetmeats and cakes at his
wedding.</p>
<p>All Friday and most of Saturday I spent in being presented to
various members of the family and in making preparations.&nbsp;
Berto recommended me to visit the barber on Saturday afternoon
and, as a good Sicilian, I followed his advice and went to the
salone of Peppino.&nbsp; When Samuel Butler first came to Mount
Eryx in 1892 to see whether he could identify the localities with
those described as Scheria and Ithaca in the <i>Odyssey</i>, he
slipped in the street and put his ankle out of joint.&nbsp; The
doctor was away, and his foot was set by Peppino, who is a
barber-surgeon with a salone close to the spot where the accident
happened.&nbsp; Accordingly Peppino is the barber I employ when I
am on the Mountain.&nbsp; While he was attending to me I observed
a change in the salone, and, on asking where the looking-glasses
were, was told they had been lent to Berto to ornament the buffet
of his wedding festa.</p>
<p>After the barber, I had my dinner, as I found there would be
no opportunity to do so when once the wedding ceremonies had
begun, and then I dressed.&nbsp; In the meantime a cloud began to
collect on the Mountain and the wind began to blow.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />
BERTO&rsquo;S WEDDING</h3>
<p>A Sicilian wedding is conducted either on system <i>a</i>,
when the happy couple go away for their honeymoon and the
ceremony is performed in the morning, or on system <i>b</i>, when
they do not go away but have a ball at home, and then the
ceremony is performed in the evening.&nbsp; The wedding of
Ignazio proceeded on system <i>a</i>, that of Berto and
Giuseppina on system <i>b</i>.&nbsp; As for Alberto Bosco, his
wedding was either a combination of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> or an
exceptional case.</p>
<p><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>Berto&rsquo;s brother Nicol&agrave;o came to fetch me
at 5.30 p.m. and took me to the house of the bride&rsquo;s
brother in the piazza, where the bride was waiting.&nbsp; Her
dress was of pale grey cr&egrave;pe trimmed with dull silver
embroidery and she wore zagara in her bonnet.&nbsp; Exceptional
cases being excepted, it may be said that brides only wear white
silk and a veil and wreath of orange blossom, as Ignazio&rsquo;s
bride did at the religious ceremony, when the wedding is
conducted on system <i>a</i>.&nbsp; I failed to discover any rule
about a cort&egrave;ge of bridesmaids, if there is such a rule it
is probably elastic.&nbsp; The other ladies wore dresses as for a
dance in England in the country in the winter.&nbsp; The
gentlemen, like the guests at the Nascita, wore evening
dress.&nbsp; And of course we all had cloaks or over-coats.</p>
<p>When we were about to leave the house, Peppi Bosco, with his
trombone and the rest of the municipal band, began to play, and
to the strains of their music we crossed the piazza in the
fog.&nbsp; The bride was conducted by her brother, the bridegroom
came next escorting a lady cousin, I followed, as compare, with
Berto&rsquo;s mother, and the others came after.&nbsp; We entered
the municipio and went upstairs into a large room.&nbsp; The
sindaco sat behind a table, the bride and bridegroom sat facing
one another in two armchairs on the opposite side of the table
and we ranged ourselves about the room.</p>
<p>The sindaco had often before sat at that table and received
other wedding parties, nevertheless he appeared at a loss, or
perhaps he disapproved of matrimony.&nbsp; At any rate he was not
going to acquiesce in the proceedings until he had dwelt, as
elderly people will, on the serious nature of the duties the
young people were proposing to undertake.&nbsp; He went so far as
to put clearly before them aspects of the case which they might
have overlooked and to read them legal extracts of a discouraging
nature.&nbsp; They were unmoved, and the sindaco, still
dissatisfied, asked Berto point-blank whether he really wished,
under the circumstances, to take Giuseppina to be his wife.&nbsp;
Berto replied in <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>the affirmative.&nbsp; Concealing
his surprise, the sindaco turned to Giuseppina and asked her
whether she wished to be married to Berto.&nbsp; She said she
did; and indeed it was the reason why we were all there, as the
sindaco must have known if he had given the matter a thought, for
the wedding had been the talk of the town since Christmas; but
the law does not regard hearsay evidence.&nbsp; Finding there was
no help for it, he pronounced the necessary words and, no doubt
with a view of disclaiming personal responsibility should he
hereafter be taxed with marriage-mongering, invited them to sign
the book with a pen made entirely of gold in the form of a
feather, which he afterwards offered them as a wedding present
with his best wishes and a paper on which his clerk had neatly
engrossed the legal extracts.</p>
<p>We descended into the piazza now vacated by Peppi Bosco, who
had been playing in it with his municipal music during the
ceremony, and, forming ourselves into a procession as before,
walked down the principal street of the town, and I was thinking
of many things.&nbsp; As we passed the club I remembered how once
in the winter Berto had taken me there and introduced me to all
the notabilities of the place and I had wondered how the fog
agreed with the billiard table.&nbsp; We passed the farmacia
where Berto spends his time making up prescriptions and gossiping
with his friends.&nbsp; We went on down the street and my
thoughts wandered to other subjects.&nbsp; In the first place
there was my hat, or rather Berto&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s hat, for,
though I had remembered about the guests at the Nascita wearing
evening clothes, I had forgotten that they brought their
cylindrical hats, and Berto had borrowed one for me, which was so
small I had to hold it on.&nbsp; And the wind blew and roared and
shook the shutters and banged the windows and doors and smashed
the glass down on to the roughly paved streets, and the dense,
chilly cloud went through the cracks and penetrated into every
house and damped the beds and discoloured the whitewash of the
walls.&nbsp; And I <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>had Berto&rsquo;s mother on one arm
and could not keep his uncle&rsquo;s hat on my head.&nbsp; At
last I took it off and carried it under my other arm, putting on
my head a cap which I happened to have in my pocket.</p>
<p>We came to the steep part of the street near the salone of
Peppino and I thought of his looking-glasses that were
temporarily adorning the future bedroom of Berto&rsquo;s compare,
and I thought of Butler&rsquo;s accident and of the authoress of
the <i>Odyssey</i> writing her poem up here three thousand years
ago.&nbsp; And what are three thousand years to Time in his
flight?&nbsp; An interval that he can clear with a flap or two of
his mighty wings.&nbsp; No one knows how often he has flapped
them since these narrow roughly paved streets began to give the
town its irregular shape; no one knows anything of the
prehistoric incarnations of her who has reigned here as
Ph&oelig;nician Astarte, as Greek Aphrodite, as Roman Venus, and
who now reigns here as Italian Maria.&nbsp; We were adding one
more to the processions that during unnumbered ages have passed
along the streets of Mount Eryx worshipping the Mystery of
Birth.</p>
<p>We turned down by the Palazzo Platamone and at last reached
the Matrice.&nbsp; The floor was hidden by the people standing on
it and the ceiling by thousands of wax candles hanging from
it.&nbsp; The organ was playing antiphonally with Peppi Bosco,
who had preceded us with his trombone and his municipal
music.&nbsp; We went into the sagrestia and I did not at first
recognise the Arciprete Messina who received us, for I had not
previously seen him in his vestments, but he knew me.&nbsp; We
had met in the street when he was wearing his ordinary clothes
the day before and I had told him I had his photograph taken by
Butler, who wanted his face because it is particularly round,
like that of so many of the Ericini, and Butler used to say they
are descended from the Cyclopes who formerly lived
here&mdash;Cyclopes means circle-faced, not one-eyed.</p>
<p>After signing the register we left the sagrestia, pushed our
way through the people, and stood outside the <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>altar-rails
in a circle, the arciprete, Berto, Giuseppina, myself and another
priest.&nbsp; I held an old silver tazza, on which the ring was
placed.&nbsp; The music was tremendous and had to be made to play
piano.&nbsp; The arciprete read the words and, at the proper
moment, I handed the tazza, from which he took the ring and gave
it to the bridegroom, who placed it upon the bride&rsquo;s
finger.&nbsp; And the Madonna di Custonaci sat over the altar
with the Child at her breast smiling down upon our little circle
and giving her blessing to Berto and Giuseppina who, with the
sanction of their relations and friends, were taking the first
step on the path that leads to motherhood.</p>
<p>We were not in the church ten minutes, and the music became
forte again as our procession passed out into the fog.&nbsp; We
went to the bride&rsquo;s house and entered by the door that
leads into the courtyard which was occupied by Peppi Bosco, who
had again preceded us with his trombone and municipal
music.&nbsp; The bride retired and, after a few moments,
reappeared among the guests, escorted by Berto and accompanied by
someone bearing a large tea-tray piled up with sugared almonds,
which she ladled to us in handfuls with a silver
coffee-cup.&nbsp; On whatever system a Sicilian wedding is
conducted it would be incomplete without sugared almonds, and
they are sent in boxes to all friends who are unable to
attend.&nbsp; Several boxes were given to me for my near
relations who, by virtue of my having become compare of Berto and
Giuseppina, are now in a manner related to them.&nbsp; And the
bride also gave me for my sister a special gift of a handkerchief
embroidered by someone in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>After the almonds, the music began in the front hall and we
danced.&nbsp; There were waltzes, polkas and contraddanze, also
games involving dances.&nbsp; I did not try to dance the waltzes
or the polkas, they were quite different from those I used to be
taught; Berto said they were dancing the ballo figurato.&nbsp;
Nor did I dance the tarantella, which I never was taught in any
form, but I saw it danced by <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Berto&rsquo;s mother and a brother of the bride.&nbsp;
I danced in three contraddanze, first with Berto&rsquo;s mother,
then with his bride, then with his sister.&nbsp; One of the
dancers called out in French what we were to do, and the mistakes
we made added to the amusement.&nbsp; Frequently there was a
promenade, the partners walking arm-in-arm round the room, which
gave time to recover ourselves when we had got into any great
confusion.&nbsp; Sometimes he who directs the contraddanza is so
fertile in invention that he can make it last two hours.&nbsp; I
do not think any that I danced lasted above half an hour, and
they always ended by our promenading away to the buffet, which
was under the joyous direction of Berto&rsquo;s father.&nbsp;
Here we ate sweetmeats and cakes and drank rosolio, which is any
kind of light liqueur.</p>
<p>Berto&rsquo;s brother Nicol&agrave;o took me away at 3 a.m.,
and I wanted someone to show me the road because the cloud was
still on the Mountain, and they do not keep the streets lighted
all night.&nbsp; But the rest danced for another hour and then
departed, leaving Berto&rsquo;s mother to attend to the bride and
to stay in the house.</p>
<p>Next day at noon we all called to inquire and I remained to
dinner at two.&nbsp; While we were at table we heard the drum
beating a Saracen rhythm and went to the window.&nbsp; It was the
festa of S. Francesco da Paola; he was coming out of his church
and going up to the balio on the top of the Mountain.&nbsp; The
fog had cleared away, leaving a few light clouds whose shadows
chased one another across the campagna and out to sea, where they
played with the islands that were swimming in it, each separate
and distinct in the brightness like those on a China plate.&nbsp;
S. Francesco turned his back to the islands; he had not come out
to bless the sea.&nbsp; Nor had he come to bless Cofano; he knew
it was beyond his power to make that rocky wilderness to blossom
as a rose.&nbsp; The translucent mountains stood back in a rugged
amphitheatre before him, reverently saluting the throne of Venus;
he acknowledged their salute, but he did not bless the barren
mountains; he <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>remembered the words of his Master:
To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall
be taken away even that which he seemeth to have.</p>
<p>Good old San Cicciu da Paola turned his eyes away from the
mountains and looked down upon the exuberance of the
campagna.&nbsp; Every patch was a mother&rsquo;s breast suckling
the young bread and wine and oil, making the little figs to swell
on their branches and the big blobby oranges to grow bigger and
blobbier among their leaves.&nbsp; The salad was pushing, pushing
up through the soil; peaches, apples, pears, medlars and plums
were forming inside their faint pink and snowy blooms; there were
almonds and blossoming pomegranates, asparagus and tomatoes,
artichokes in disorderly tufts and beans combed into tidy
rows.&nbsp; In the hollow places, like marshy pools reflecting
the sky, lay beds of pale blue flax to be woven into wedding
sheets for Mount Eryx.</p>
<p>San Cicciu looked upon it and saw that it was good, and he
blessed all that fertility.&nbsp; He was doing for the campagna
what the Cyclopean arciprete had asked the Madonna to do for
Berto and Giuseppina.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />
SULPHUR</h3>
<p>Caltanissetta is a busy town of some 45,000 inhabitants near
the middle of the island and about 2000 feet above the sea.&nbsp;
It depends for its prosperity on almonds, grapes, olives and
sulphur, especially the last, for there is much sulphur in the
pores of the rock.&nbsp; I have several friends there of whom
one, Beppe (Giuseppe) Catena, is an engineer with an interest in
Trabonella, the largest sulphur mine in the neighbourhood, and
another, Gigino (Luigi) Cordova, is an advocate.&nbsp; Sometimes
Beppe is in the town and sometimes Gigino and I go to Trabonella
and find him there.&nbsp; It is an hour&rsquo;s drive along a
road that winds among rolling hills.&nbsp; Through the
depressions between the near hills other hills appear, and
through their depressions higher hills, and beyond these are
higher hills again until the view is bounded by the Monti delle
Madonie where the snow lingers until May.&nbsp; It must have been
some such country as this that was in the mind of him who first
spoke of the sea running mountains high.</p>
<p>I do not know whether it is more beautiful in spring or in
autumn.&nbsp; I know that in spring the grass under the orange
trees is spotted with purple flowers, and that crimson vetch
incarnadines the hills, as though Lady Macbeth had dipped her
little hand into their multitudinous green; the hedges bloom with
rosemary and scarlet geranium, the banks with sweet pea and
brilliant mesembryanthemum, and the rough places are full of
asphodel; there are a few eucalyptus trees and now and then a
solemn row of cypresses; we may pass a hut of grey thatch and
perhaps a few horses or a sprinkling of tethered goats; sometimes
we see a herd of bullocks tended by a boy who <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>has come
out this morning in black sheep-skin leggings up to his hips, and
I think he learnt his song from happy nightingales that set the
April moonlight to music.</p>
<p>But in autumn the prospect is as fair.&nbsp; The harvest is
over; the earth, bronzed by the summer heat, is resting after her
labour and nature is making variations in the ochres and umbers
that in spring were half hidden, huddled together in the steep
places where nothing will flourish; the stubble shows in lines of
pale yellow on the brown earth among patches of almost colourless
green and other patches black with burning which change the value
of the olives, pistachios, carubas and aloes; here and there is a
shrivelled thistle, here and there a lone pine; sometimes we see
a string of mules winding in and out on its way home, losing and
finding itself among the undulations like a little fleet of
fishing boats that rise and fall with the swell, and I think
Schubert must have passed this way when he felt stirring within
him the mellow loveliness of the second Entr&rsquo;acte to
<i>Rosamunde</i>:</p>

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>We need not choose one or the other, we need only wait
to have both; for spring is the modulation to the dominant, the
awakening, the going out in search of adventure, while autumn is
the return to the tonic, the coming home in search of repose, the
falling asleep; the first leads to the second as naturally as
youth leads to age.</p>
<p>Last time Gigino and I went to Trabonella it was spring, and
we took with us his young brother Michelino, aged thirteen, who
had never been there before.&nbsp; We arrived in the afternoon
and found Beppe, who took us round, and we showed Michelino the
works.&nbsp; Empty trucks were gliding down a sloping railway
into the mine, while others were gliding up filled with the
harvest of the deep.&nbsp; We saw the broken pieces of rock being
put into great furnaces and we watched the treacly sulphur that
was melted out of the pores and came oozing through a tap into a
mould.&nbsp; It is then purified and made into shapes like
candles, and I thought of Kentish giants handling such bars of
sulphur to fumigate the hops in the glow of an oast-house
fire.&nbsp; We introduced Michelino to the overseers, directors
and managers and to the doctor.&nbsp; We returned to the hut
where Beppe lives, and dined out of doors in the yard
behind.&nbsp; It all seemed to me very healthy and like the
accounts one reads and the illustrations one sees of life in a
new country, with the advantage that Caltanissetta is only about
eight kilometres away.&nbsp; But Beppe objected that the nearness
of Caltanissetta was no advantage because it induces a feeling of
&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter; I can always go to town for
that,&rdquo; and so they put up with much that they might remedy
if they were really beyond the reach of civilisation.&nbsp;
Consequently he was not able to treat us as we deserved.&nbsp; We
replied that we were glad it was so, because he was treating us
much better.</p>
<p>After dinner we joined the other managers and directors in a
room of a larger building; a mandoline and guitar were brought
and some of them played.&nbsp; Presently Michelino sang.&nbsp; He
surprised me by the beauty and power of his young voice and by
his management of it, also by his <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>musical
intelligence and by his complete self-possession.&nbsp; He sang
the tenor songs of many operas and other popular melodies,
especially I remember his singing the <i>Stornelli
Montagnoli</i>, which is so beautiful that the buffo said it
would save itself in the Escape from Paris.&nbsp; To all this the
guitar-player vamped an accompaniment which Michelino
relentlessly silenced by a gesture when it became
unbearable.&nbsp; It was absurd to see him lording it over the
company, nearly a dozen of us and the youngest nearly old enough
to be his father.&nbsp; When it was time to retire, beds were
found for the visitors and I passed a comfortable night in
Beppe&rsquo;s hut.</p>
<p>Next day we were taken into the mine to see what goes on
underneath the freedom of the rolling hills.&nbsp; We dived down
in a lift, ever so deep into the darkness, and probably it was
dangerous, but when I go down lifts and see over mines, as when I
wander among the tottering ruins of Messina, I have learnt to
hope that the accident will be some other day.&nbsp; We saw
nearly naked men, monsters of the abyss, crouching in cavernous
places, pick-axing the sulphurous rock in the dim light of their
miner&rsquo;s lamps, while others were bringing broken pieces
along the low, dark galleries and sending them up in the trucks
to the light.&nbsp; And the workers were groaning and moaning as
they worked.&nbsp; Day after day, always the same monotonous
groaning and moaning, always the same monotonous pick-axing the
rock in the dim light, always the same monotonous sending up the
broken pieces.&nbsp; It was very hot in some places and very cold
in others, and I was glad to follow the broken pieces up and
return to the fresh air and the sunshine.</p>
<p>Beppe told me that Trabonella is the largest sulphur mine in
Europe, that the total length of its galleries is thirty
kilometres, which is about as far as from the Albert Hall to
Windsor Castle.&nbsp; They employ a thousand miners, and the boys
begin work outside the mine at twelve and inside at
fifteen.&nbsp; There has been an alteration in the law; formerly
<!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>they began younger and were deprived of the little
education for which they now have time, and the hard work so
deformed their tender bodies that they could not pass the army
test.&nbsp; This is their modulation to the dominant, their
awakening to life.&nbsp; It is not a pleasing prospect; nor is
the early autumn of ill-health and decrepitude to which it
naturally leads any more pleasing.&nbsp; They pass their lives in
the dark, morally and physically, and frequently a sudden fall of
rock cripples, if it does not destroy, the victim; then there are
broken pieces of a different kind to be taken along the low dark
galleries and brought up to the light.</p>
<p>I was in Caltanissetta one Saturday evening and saw the
funeral of two who had been killed in this way that
morning.&nbsp; First came a band playing a funeral march, that
was all the more melancholy because the instruments were
distressingly discordant, as though in their grief the men had
not had time to tune them.&nbsp; Then came comrades carrying
candles, and comrades bearing first one coffin, then the second,
plain wooden coffins with no pall.&nbsp; Others carried chairs on
which the coffins were rested when the bearers were
changed.&nbsp; There were no priests.&nbsp; But there were
priests the next day for the wedding of another comrade.&nbsp;
Beppe told me that about 90 per cent of their funerals are
conducted without priests and about 90 per cent of their weddings
are conducted with priests.</p>
<p>They told me of one sulphur-miner who, having seen enough
funerals, left the mine and went to Palermo in search of
work.&nbsp; He was taken on by a contractor who was levelling a
piece of high ground, on which blocks of dwellings have since
been erected behind the Teatro Massimo, and began work at six
o&rsquo;clock one morning.&nbsp; Five minutes later he was killed
and buried by a fall of earth.</p>
<p>In the mine they are in constant fear of this death.&nbsp;
They work very hard and the air is bad; they come up to sleep, to
eat and to gamble.&nbsp; The air they sleep in cannot be much
better than that in the mine, for they are laid out in close huts
on shelves, like rolls of stuff in a draper&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp;
They <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>hardly know the difference between
youth and age, between spring and autumn.&nbsp; They scarcely get
a glimpse of the landscape except on Saturdays and Sundays, and
then they are intent upon something else.&nbsp; After their week
of labour they feel the necessity of expansion; they receive
their wages and go to Caltanissetta; those who are married sleep
with their wives, while those who are unmarried sleep quite alone
as the soldiers did after the death and burial of
l&rsquo;Invincible Monsieur d&rsquo;Malbrough.&nbsp; They become
free human beings for two days.&nbsp; I have seen the piazza full
of them on Sunday morning&mdash;so full that I thought it would
have been easier to walk across it, treading on their heads, than
to push through the crowd.&nbsp; Unfortunately their notion of
the life of a free human being does not stop at loafing about in
the piazza.&nbsp; They also go to the wine shops, where they
offer one another the means of forgetting that their oases of
rest lie in a desert of drudgery, and sometimes this becomes the
means of their forgetting everything else as well.</p>
<p>Gigino has written a paper upon the connection between
alcoholism and crime.&nbsp; He told me that the consumption of
alcohol in Sicily is less than in northern countries, but that
there is more crime.&nbsp; I naturally inquired whether it would
not tend to lessen the crime if the Sicilians would drink rather
more.&nbsp; He replied that, as so often happens at the beginning
of any inquiry, there are other considerations and I must not be
in a hurry.&nbsp; As for the sulphur-miners, they need not drink
more, but if they would spread fairly over the week the amount
they consume during Saturday and Sunday, then, although they
would risk incurring the consequences of chronic alcoholism, they
would avoid those of acute alcoholism.&nbsp; For the need of
expansion causes them to drink more than they can stand all at
once, then they quarrel and commit murders.&nbsp; So that many of
those who begin life as boys in the mine, and week after week
escape the falling rocks, live to be killed in a drunken brawl,
and one does not know which prospect is the more ugly.</p>
<p><!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>I asked whether their condition could not be improved
by raising their wages.&nbsp; They asked whether I wished to
dislocate the commerce of the world by raising the price of
sulphur.&nbsp; I had no such desire and, indeed, did not know,
till they told me, that sulphur enters into so many manufactures
as it does.&nbsp; Here again in seeking to ameliorate conditions
with which one is imperfectly familiar one must not be in a
hurry.&nbsp; It is not altogether a question of raising their
wages, they receive from four and a half to five francs a day,
which, for five days, amounts to between twenty-two francs fifty
and twenty-five francs a week; there are many labourers who
receive less and do more with it.&nbsp; Of course, they would
like more wages&mdash;everyone would like more wages&mdash;but
what the sulphur-miners really want is the intelligence to use
wisely what they have and also some change, if it were possible,
in the conditions under which their work is done.&nbsp; Beppe
assured me that the question is not being overlooked, but it has
roots which extend further and are more complicated than the
galleries in the mine&mdash;roots which are tangled with the
roots of other questions affecting other interests, and these
again affect others.&nbsp; So I bowed before the other
considerations and hoped that with the changes that are
continually taking place in Sicily something may soon be done for
the sulphur-miners, trusting that in the meantime we are not
paying too dearly for the advantage of getting our sulphur so
cheap.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />
OMERT&Agrave; AND THE MAFIA</h3>
<p>When the drunken sulphur-miners quarrel and kill one another
on Saturdays and Sundays, the murderers are seldom brought to
justice because of Omert&agrave;; a word which is said to be
derived from uomo and to signify manliness in the sense of power
of endurance, the power, for <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>example, of
keeping silence even under torture; hence it comes to be used for
an exaggeration of that natural sense of honour, that Noblesse
Oblige or Decency Forbids, which makes an English schoolboy scorn
to become a sneak.&nbsp; It may be false and foolish, it may be
noble and chivalrous, whatever it is, they say, it has such a
firm growth among them because the history of Sicily is the
history of an island which has for centuries been misgoverned by
foreigners, and the people have lost any faith they may ever have
had in professional justice.&nbsp; If one were to be involved
with a Sicilian in committing a crime, one might be perfectly
certain that he would never turn King&rsquo;s evidence, he would
say, &ldquo;Io son uomo, io non parlo&rdquo; (&ldquo;I am a man,
I know how to hold my tongue&rdquo;) and he would rather die than
betray an accomplice who is his friend and probably his
compare.&nbsp; Nor need the criminal fear that the victim or
anyone in the secret whether accomplice or not, will blab.&nbsp;
A man with a wound on his face, made obviously by a knife, will
swear to the police that in drawing a cork he fell and cut
himself with the bottle.&nbsp; He does not intend his assailant
to go unpunished, but he will not have the police interfering if
he can prevent it; he means to look after his own affairs
himself.&nbsp; If a murder has been committed a crowd will
collect round the murdered man&mdash;a crowd that includes the
police and also the murderer&mdash;but no one has any idea who
committed the crime, not even those who saw it done, and not even
the dying man, who may carry his assumption of ignorance so far
as to call his murderer to his side, embrace him affectionately
and give him a Judas-kiss which bears a double meaning; for the
police and the general public it is evidence that there can have
been no ill-feeling between the two, while for the friends of the
murdered man it confirms their suspicions as to the one on whom
the vendetta is to be executed.&nbsp; So many have told me this
that I cannot help thinking that, if it really is done as often
as they say, it must by now have lost some of its power of
deceiving the police.&nbsp; Probably it was done on <!-- page
159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>some occasion which took the public fancy, and they
keep on repeating it because it makes a dramatic close.</p>
<p>Giovanni Grasso has a play called <i>Omert&agrave;</i>:<i> La
Legge del Silenzio</i>.&nbsp; Don Andrea has been murdered by or
at the instigation of Don Tot&ograve; (Salvatore), who is an
overbearing bully, nevertheless Saru (Rosario) has been sent to
prison for the crime and, during his absence, his girl has
married Don Tot&ograve;.&nbsp; The play opens with the return
from prison of Saru, acted by Giovanni.&nbsp; He comes to the
house of his mother, with whom Don Tot&ograve; and his wife are
living.&nbsp; The length of the play is provided by the
disappointments attending his return: his setting up for himself
and painting paladins on Sicilian carts; a scene of passionate
tenderness with his mother, during which he convinces her of his
innocence, but refuses to reveal the name of the murderer which
he has learnt in prison; a beautiful interview with Pasqualino,
his young brother, who shows he is the right sort of boy by
declaring of his own accord that he hates Don Tot&ograve;; a
magnificent interrupted quarrel with Don Tot&ograve;, and scenes
with the police and with the priest to whom Saru refuses to give
any information about the murder.&nbsp; Towards the end Saru
staggers in wounded.&nbsp; They all try to make him tell the name
of his murderer, but he will not.&nbsp; Finally, he is left alone
with Pasqualino to whom he gives his revolver with these dying
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Don Tot&ograve;, when you shall be
eighteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pasqualino understands, kisses the pistol and accepts the
obligation, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others return and ask Pasqualino whether Saru told him
anything before he died, and Pasqualino, concealing the pistol in
his bosom as the Spartan boy concealed the fox, bravely
answers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One may object to the play on the ground that it breaks off
instead of coming to a conclusion&mdash;one is left wishing to
see Pasqualino, grown up and acted by Giovanni, executing <!--
page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>the vendetta&mdash;but it is a good play and shows what
is meant by omert&agrave;.&nbsp; The dramatic critic of the
<i>Times</i> (2 March, 1910), on the morning after Giovanni
produced it in London, opened his notice of it thus:
&ldquo;Omert&agrave; must make things very difficult for the
Sicilian police.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is precisely what they
intend.</p>
<p>Without omert&agrave; the mafia would hardly flourish, and the
mafia is not so easy to understand.&nbsp; I suppose the reason
why Sicilians explain it badly is that they understand it too
well.&nbsp; The inquiring outsider cannot see the trees for the
wood, and the explaining insider cannot see the wood for the
trees.&nbsp; They labour to make clear things with which I am
familiar, and take for granted things which are strange to me,
treating me rather as my father treated the judges before whom he
was arguing some legal point.&nbsp; Their lordships interrupted
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Jones, you say this is so and that is so, but
you do not produce any authority in support of your
statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Authority, my lord?&rdquo; exclaimed my father, as
though perhaps he might have forgotten something: then, leaning
over the desk, he said, in a stage whisper: &ldquo;Usher, bring
me <i>Blackstone</i>&mdash;or some other elementary
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we do not make much progress, but by degrees one picks up
a few ideas about it.</p>
<p>My friend Peppino Fazio, of Catania, allowed me to copy and
translate part of an article he wrote in a newspaper.&nbsp; He is
speaking of Palermo as long ago as 1780:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Albergheria was the quarter that harboured
those men who were most ready with their hands and most
quarrelsome; they were expert also in using their knives, with
which they fenced by rule and according to art; they obeyed a
certain code of chivalry of their own, not permitting the weak or
the unarmed to be bullied, treating as criminals those who used
fraud and treachery, and not brooking the intervention of the
police.&nbsp; They were men whom an exaggerated sentiment of
honour and of individual courage had decoyed from the path <!--
page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>of social conventions, but in whom there was a
fundamental notion of right conduct and a generosity at times
magnanimous.&nbsp; They held each other in great mutual respect,
free from any element of servility or cowardice, not recognising
grades, nor conferring any right to command&mdash;a respect that
was the more profound according as its object was the more
distinguished for acts of valour and grandeur of soul.&nbsp; It
was the tacit homage that one pays to heroes, poets, artists and
to every kind of genius.</p>
<p>These men, slowly degenerating, have produced the mafia, which
is associated with bullying, blackmailing and crime.&nbsp; The
word mafia has been applied in this bad sense only in more recent
times, as we are assured by those who have studied the
subject.&nbsp; The ancestors of the mafiosi used to call
themselves Cristiani&mdash;that is Men in the sense of men of
courage and silence.</p>
<p>The Cristiano carried in one pocket his rosary and in the
other his knife.&nbsp; Outside his own class he recognised the
higher social distinctions and, while preserving his own
self-respect and never stooping to obsequiousness, felt for the
galantuomini (that is for the townspeople) and for the signori
(that is for the patricians) a real submission which he displayed
both in acts and words by protecting their persons and their
reputations; so that no thief or evil-liver dared to commit any
crime against one who was known to be protected by a
Cristiano.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One recognises about this something of the chivalry of Robin
Hood and of more modern highwaymen.&nbsp; The conditions of life
in the albergheria are not identical with those of life in the
open country, either in England or in Sicily, nor with those of
life in the orange-groves of the Conca d&rsquo;Oro round about
Palermo.&nbsp; Both in the Conca d&rsquo;Oro and in the open
fields the guardians employed to protect the crops are all
mafiosi and are able to prevent the employment of any who are
not.&nbsp; The conditions in a sulphur-mine again are
different.&nbsp; Confusion arises unless one knows which
conditions are present to the mind of him who is trying to
explain the mafia.&nbsp; Besides which, the words mafia and
mafioso are still often used in a good sense.</p>
<p><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>There was something mafioso about Michelino when he was
singing to us at the mine, keeping us all in order and silencing
the guitar with a wave of his hand.&nbsp; There is something of
it in a girl who is not ashamed of her beauty and does not blush
to be admired.&nbsp; It was the mafiosit&agrave; of Guido Santo,
the mule, at Castellinaria, that sunny morning when he trotted up
and down in his new harness before taking us to the shore, which
put it into our heads to make it also his festa.&nbsp; There is
something of it in the attitude of King Henry VIII, with his hat
on one side and his arm a-kimbo, as he appears in a full-length
portrait by Holbein.&nbsp; There was a good deal of it in the
conduct of Giovanni in his Teatro Machiavelli on one occasion
when a lady music-hall singer failed to please; the public hissed
her and made such an uproar that she could not proceed.&nbsp;
Giovanni was, or pretended to be, furious.&nbsp; He behaved to
his audience as Nino Bixio behaved to his men on the Sicilian
expedition.&nbsp; He came on and abused them with gesticulation
and language; he swore and stormed at them; he appealed to their
sense of chivalry; he threatened to come down among them and
teach them manners; he declared that they should hear her.&nbsp;
He made the piano-man play; he went and fetched the lady; he
stood by her side, frowning, with his arms folded, ready to break
out, the personification of angry determination and suppressed
energy.&nbsp; The people acquiesced and listened.&nbsp; When the
singer had finished, they applauded; and they were applauding not
only her, but also Giovanni because he had dominated them.&nbsp;
It is a small theatre and their numbers may have been four or
five hundred&mdash;it would depend upon the programme and the
kind of evening it was&mdash;but if it had been the Teatro
Bellini he would have subdued them just as well, unless there had
been present someone to resist him with a stronger personality,
and his experience had taught him that the chances were against
that.</p>
<p>An imposing personality is a useless possession unless there
are others willing to be imposed upon, and it is this <!-- page
163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>willingness to be dominated quite as much as the love
of dominating that makes the mafia possible.&nbsp; If I may
&ldquo;quote from memory&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Surely the pleasure is as great<br />
Of being beaten as to beat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Possibly the Sicilian charm contains among its many
ingredients a trace of this love of being dominated which, in
England, we associate more particularly with women, spaniels and
walnut trees; and if it were not so, history might contain less
about the misgovernment of the island by foreigners.</p>
<p>The mafia is not like the Neapolitan Camorra, it is not an
organised society such as one reads about in books for boys, nor
is it a recognised trade union with a president, secretary,
officers and so on.&nbsp; It is rather an esprit de corps, and no
more a secret society than omert&agrave; is a secret society;
nevertheless, they speak of the mafia as being more highly
organised in some districts than in others, and there are secret
societies whose members are mafiosi, so that for a foreigner to
speak of the mafia as a secret society would appear to be an
excusable error.</p>
<p>Among every collection of men, and even in a herd of bullocks,
one is always the acknowledged leader, and in a sulphur-mine it
naturally happens that one man has a more dominating personality,
more prepotenza, than any of the others; this capo-mafioso takes
the lead and is king.&nbsp; When, as often happens, he is a man
with a respect for law and order, willing to be useful to the
managers, the mafia can and does supplement in an amateur fashion
the deficiencies of professional justice.&nbsp; If Giovanni
Grasso were really a worker in a sulphur-mine, as he sometimes
appears to be on the stage, he would certainly take the lead, and
no one who knows him will believe that he could ever be capable
of a bad action.&nbsp; But few men can safely be trusted with
absolute power.&nbsp; Sometimes this capo-mafioso is a villain
who glories in a record of crime, a brow-beating bully who will
<!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>stick at nothing.&nbsp; Here is a situation for a
melodrama&mdash;the Wicked Despot.&nbsp; He does as he chooses
with those around him, who fear lest he should treat them as Don
Tot&ograve; treated Don Andrea before the opening of
<i>Omert&agrave;</i>, and as he treats Saru in the course of the
play; and they not only fear, they also admire an
unscrupulousness of which they feel themselves to be
incapable.&nbsp; They refer their disputes to him and execute his
orders.&nbsp; They do not pay him money for adjudicating between
them, it is enough for him to have the satisfaction of being
asked to arbitrate and, by giving his decision and seeing that it
is carried out, he consolidates his power.&nbsp; But he exacts
from them a percentage of their winnings at cards as tribute, and
they pay it willingly so as to keep on good terms with him.&nbsp;
Of course, under the throne of any of these tyrants, among those
who have sufficient daring, conspiracies are continually surging
and, sooner or later, whether he is a good or a bad man, he has
to give way to a stronger&mdash;perhaps a fresh arrival, who
takes the public fancy.&nbsp; Sometimes there are two with
apparently an equal power of dominating; they agree not to
quarrel openly, but, between themselves, each is on the look-out
for an opportunity to annihilate the other&rsquo;s influence.</p>
<p>One Saturday, in the street at Caltanissetta, Beppe showed me
marks of bullets on the wall.&nbsp; He said that only a week
before there had been a row among a score of men with revolvers
about some question of precedence among the mafiosi in a
neighbouring mine arising out of the terms proposed for ending a
strike.&nbsp; One of the men was killed and several were wounded,
but the question of precedence could not be settled that day
because the survivors were all put into prison.</p>
<p>According to the plays, the prisons are to the mafiosi what
the ganglia are to the nerves, and give the prisoners an
opportunity for talking matters over, thus providing an effective
means of continuing the plot of the drama.&nbsp; And though the
criminals feel secure in the knowledge that <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>omert&agrave; will prevent their confederates from
giving information, yet the police, of course, know who is who
all the time, just as the police in London know who are the
criminals; the law, however, is jealous of the rights of the
people and does not move on suspicion.&nbsp; And too much of the
modern police methods would not combine well with the
requirements of melodrama.</p>
<p>Beppe assured me that in his mine the mafiosi are mostly good
fellows and do not do any harm, except among themselves when they
quarrel, get drunk and murder one another.&nbsp; He admits that
the making use of them in the management of the men is like
playing with fire, but he agrees with all who have gone into the
matter that a stranger falling among them, wherever he might meet
them, would be treated with the most extreme respect and
courtesy.&nbsp; This is not because they are afraid of giving
themselves away, distrusting the stranger&rsquo;s omert&agrave;,
it is because they have a real self-respect and wish to pass in
the eyes of the world for men of good position.&nbsp; The
presence of a stranger among them is a challenge to their
chivalry and to their oriental sense of hospitality.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to study the mafia from books might begin with
<i>La Mafia e I Mafiosi</i>, by Antonio Cutrera, Delegato di
Pubblica Sicurezza (Palermo.&nbsp; Alberto Reber, 1900), and
continue with <i>La Mala Vita di Palermo</i> (<i>I
Ricottari</i>), by the same author.&nbsp; If he will also read
all the numerous books by other authors cited in the notes to
these two works he ought to gain a fair knowledge of the
subject.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />
MALA VITA</h3>
<p>Sicilians sometimes claim that much of what has been stated in
the foregoing chapter is now out of date, and that, with the
advance of civilisation, the power of the mafia <!-- page
166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>and the respect for omert&agrave; are giving way to
confidence in the police.&nbsp; And they go on to regret that
Giovanni Grasso should have so much success with his plays in
foreign countries, because they contain a great deal of mafia and
mala vita which he presents with so much realism that foreigners
are encouraged in the idea that all Sicilians are for ever
sleeplessly going about with knives in their belts seeking to
execute vendettas.&nbsp; But most theatre-goers know by this time
that melodramas are not made up of the events of ordinary
life.&nbsp; A man does not discover every day that he has been
deceived by his wife or that his sister has been betrayed by his
compare; when he does make such a discovery he may be pardoned if
he loses his self-control.&nbsp; Anyhow, the sleepless vendetta
notion is so ludicrously contrary to the fact that Sicily can
afford to take the risk.&nbsp; One might as well treat seriously
the complaint against the marionettes, that the swaggering talk
of Orlando and Rinaldo encourages the boys to behave in real life
as though every fancied insult must be wiped out with
blood.&nbsp; The boys certainly do fight&mdash;they can be seen
fighting in the fish-market, one armed with a basket for his
shield and another with a stick for his sword, his
Durlindana.&nbsp; But boys fight, even in England, with no
marionettes to inflame their imaginations, and sometimes they cut
one another; still, no one would take too seriously the
exclamation of that schoolmaster who, on being called to deal
with some such incident, hurried from his study muttering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knives, knives&mdash;dangerous weapons; would to heaven
they had never been invented!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was he going to do at dinner-time?&nbsp; And if the
marionettes are to be abolished, what is the Sicilian boy to do
when it is time for him to sit down to his evening meal of
romance?&nbsp; It is even possible that if he were starved of his
marionettes he would more frequently substitute the dangerous
weapon for the stick.</p>
<p>We see Sicilian life only in bits at a time and any bit we see
may turn out on investigation to be only a bit of <!-- page
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>acting; and, whether real life or acting, we see it
through the veil of romance which is held in front of it by their
language and by their gestures, which cause their acting to
appear more real&mdash;that is, which help it to be more
deceptive.&nbsp; By their language I do not mean merely their
words and their grammar&mdash;we also have a grammar, and our
dictionary contains words as many and as expressive as
theirs&mdash;the romance is rather in their attitude of mind and
the consequent use they make of their words.&nbsp; I have read
with disgust in an English newspaper an account of a squalid
Pentonville murder which, as described in a contemporary Italian
journal, appeared worthy to be set to music by Puccini.&nbsp; We
are like the audience in Giovanni&rsquo;s theatre&mdash;dominated
by the imposing romance of the language, and we prefer to be so
dominated.&nbsp; Or we are like the audience in the teatrino at
Palermo, when the buffo performs a miracle; as soon as we get
behind &ldquo;la mala vita&rdquo; and see it as &ldquo;the life
of the criminal classes&rdquo; we have caught a glimpse of how
the illusion is worked.</p>
<p>By their gestures I mean something about which in England, in
France and even in Northern Italy, nothing is known.&nbsp; It is
true that we Northerners can and do communicate with one another
in gesture, but in England we mostly omit gesture and use speech,
while in France and Northern Italy the gesture is only
slight.&nbsp; A Sicilian sometimes omits words, but if he omits
gestures it is only by exercising great self-control.&nbsp; When
he is talking naturally, every muscle of his body is at work
helping him to express his meaning.&nbsp; It is as though he had
not yet learnt to trust speech, everything must be acted too, as
half-educated people have not yet learnt to trust the written
word and if they read must read aloud.&nbsp; At a cinematograph
show, when a letter or telegram or the title of the piece is
shown on the screen, a murmur goes round the hall; it is the
people reading the writing out loud to assure themselves of its
meaning.&nbsp; So the talking Sicilian is telling everything
twice, once with his voice and once with his gestures and <!--
page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>there is so much oil in his backbone that there is
nothing creaky, awkward or grudging in his movements; the
gestures are made with an exuberance, an intensity and a natural
unconscious beauty which seem to lift the matter above the plane
of ordinary life.&nbsp; So habitual is this gesticulation that it
is often useless.&nbsp; I have been behind the scenes in a
marionette theatre, watching the man declaiming for the
figures.&nbsp; His energy was tremendous, no wonder he drank out
of a black bottle from time to time.&nbsp; I knew he was hidden
from the audience and thought he might be suggesting movements
for the marionettes to the man who was manipulating them, but
that man could not see him either and was improvising the
movements of the figures unaided.</p>
<p>The gesticulating Sicilian, however, is not more deeply moved
by what he is describing than the phlegmatic Englishman is when
he is quietly telling something.&nbsp; I have sometimes ventured
to laugh at the Sicilian for his unnecessary vehemence, and he
has stopped in the middle of it all and joined in the
laughter.&nbsp; It would be extremely interesting to see Giovanni
Grasso in the part of an English gentleman, a Wyndham or a
Hawtrey part.&nbsp; I believe he would succeed because I believe
he would succeed in anything he set his mind to do, but for him
to reproduce an Englishman&rsquo;s tranquillity would be as much
of an effort as it would be for an English actor to reproduce a
Sicilian&rsquo;s mobility.</p>
<p>Their power of acting is not confined to those who are actors
by profession; the love of improvising little scenes in daily
life may be said to be characteristic of them.&nbsp; To suppose
that they do this from a love of lying would be to simplify
unduly; they have the artist&rsquo;s power of seeing a thing in
two senses at once, and they assume that they will not be
misunderstood, at all events, they are not going to give it all
away by explaining, and if the stranger is taken in&mdash;well,
as a rule, it does not very much signify.&nbsp; Just as
omert&agrave; makes things difficult for the Sicilian police, so
this <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>love of acting makes things
difficult for the foreign traveller.&nbsp; There is a story in
the form of a dialogue between a foreigner in Palermo inquiring
of a native about a tree that was clipped into a fantastic
shape.&nbsp; It can hardly be given in English because it turns
on the double meaning of &ldquo;naturale,&rdquo; which means
sometimes &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and sometimes
&ldquo;naturally,&rdquo; but if it be added that
&ldquo;scusi&rdquo; = &ldquo;excuse me&rdquo;;
&ldquo;quest&rsquo; albero&rdquo; = &ldquo;this tree&rdquo;;
&ldquo;&egrave;&rdquo; = &ldquo;is&rdquo;; &ldquo;o&rdquo; =
&ldquo;or,&rdquo; any reader will be able to understand it:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Foreigner</span>: Scusi, Signore;
quest&rsquo; albero &egrave; artificiale o naturale?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Palermitan</span>: Artificiale.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span>: Oh, artificiale?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pal</span>: Naturale.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span>: &Egrave; naturale?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pal</span>: Artificiale.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span>: (<i>getting irritated</i>):
Scusi, Signore; quest&rsquo; albero &egrave; artificiale o
naturale?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pal</span>: Artificiale, naturale.</p>
<p>And then the foreigner goes home and writes a book about his
travels, saying that the natives are so stupid they do not even
know whether their trees are clipped into odd shapes by nature or
art.&nbsp; But the apparently grave and courteous Palermitan knew
what he was doing all the time and was enjoying it as a child
enjoys committing a harmless piece of mischief.</p>
<p>If one were to pierce through it and understand them as they
may be supposed to understand themselves, one would not
necessarily be in a position to give an opinion about the mafia,
for, besides those who speak of the growing confidence in the
police, there are others who assert that the improvement, if any,
is slight and only on the surface, and that the spirit of the
mafia is not confined to the mala vita, but extends to the upper
classes and influences even the administration of justice and the
elections.&nbsp; When the natives differ on such a point, a mere
foreigner can hardly <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>decide; but I have more frequently
heard the opinion expressed in favour of improvement.&nbsp;
Certainly, in the Teatro Machiavelli, when murderers are taken by
the police it is often done now with the approval of the
audience, which they tell me would not have been the case some
years back.</p>
<p>Before writing about the mala vita one ought at least to have
seen a man murdered in the street.&nbsp; I have never seen this,
nor have I ever even seen the body of a murdered man lying in the
street.&nbsp; All that I know about the mala vita in Sicily has
been gathered from conversation, books and plays.&nbsp; Lest it
should be thought that in thus disclaiming practical knowledge of
the subject I am inspired by omert&agrave;&mdash;as a traveller
may shut his eyes to unpleasant incidents out of regard for his
hosts&mdash;I will here collect together all the occasions when I
have thought myself to be in the immediate neighbourhood of the
mala vita.</p>
<p>At Castellinaria the barber who keeps the shop opposite the
Albergo della Madonna&mdash;the shop in which Alfio Mascalucia
was assistant&mdash;always seemed to me to be a man one would
readily trust with all one&rsquo;s possessions.&nbsp; He must be
now over forty, married and with a family.&nbsp; Peppino told me
the other day that in his youth, meaning between the ages of
eighteen and twenty-six, this barber had been a notorious
ricottaro and had often been in prison for crimes of various
kinds.&nbsp; When I heard this, his extremely courteous manner
reminded me of the Robin Hood side of the Cristiani, and of the
oriental hospitality of the mafiosi towards strangers.&nbsp; I
asked Peppino whether I ought to discontinue my custom.&nbsp; He
said not unless I was dissatisfied with him as a barber.&nbsp;
Then I realised that I must have forgotten where I was for the
moment.</p>
<p>Carmelo and his brother Rosario at Castellinaria have both
been in prison for attempting to murder, but they can neither of
them be said ever to have belonged to the class of habitual
criminals.</p>
<p>In the Teatro Machiavelli Peppino Fazio gave me as a <!-- page
171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>ricordo one of the knives used by the mafiosi.&nbsp;
The blade doubles on the handle, so that when open it is about
twice as long as when shut; some are as long as twenty-four
inches when open, mine is only eighteen.&nbsp; Being intended for
the theatre, it has never been sharpened or pointed but, except
for this it is a real mala vita knife.&nbsp; They told me there
would be nothing to fear so long as I continued the life of
blameless respectability which had no doubt become habitual to
me&mdash;or some nonsense of that kind&mdash;but that if I should
happen to be caught by the police in doubtful surroundings and
searched, even this knife, in spite of its arrested adolescence,
might get me into trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you had better be careful,&rdquo; said one of them;
&ldquo;but if you do get put into prison, let us know and you
shall be treated as well as any ricottaro.&nbsp; I will bring you
a good dinner every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;and I will bring you
cigarettes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said a third, &ldquo;will fetch your
linen and bring it back to you nicely washed and
ironed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whenever I show my knife to any of my English friends, for I
am happy to say I got it safely home, they always exclaim that it
is an entirely prosaic object.&nbsp; And so it is.&nbsp; It is as
unromantic as an escape of gas.</p>
<p>Several times I have been in a theatre when the performance
has been interrupted by a disturbance among the audience, but I
have never seen it develop into a serious row.</p>
<p>Once in Palermo my bedroom looked over a small piazza, and one
night I heard talking and looked out.&nbsp; I saw a crowd and
distinguished a man disputing from below with another man on a
balcony about fifteen feet from mine, and there was a woman in
the room behind him.&nbsp; The dispute was all in dialect, but
evidently they were very angry.&nbsp; Presently the man on the
balcony drew a revolver, it shone in the doubtful light, and he
threatened the man below; but nothing further happened and
presently the crowd dispersed, the man on the balcony retired and
all <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>was quiet.&nbsp; Perhaps this was
the prelude to a murder, and I may have read about it afterwards
in the newspaper without knowing how near I had been to the
crime.</p>
<p>There was one other occasion when I thought I was going to see
something of the mala vita.&nbsp; On the cliff at Castellinaria
are some remains of polygonal buildings which have been made a
national monument.&nbsp; The custode&rsquo;s cabin is just below,
in a sheltered place where Peppino and I sometimes go and sit
after supper.&nbsp; One moonlight evening, it was rather late,
but the lamp was still shining in the cabin and the custode was
still hanging about, I heard someone approaching and, looking up,
saw, against the sky, a sinewy, slight woman in a long black
dress with a black shawl over her head.&nbsp; She was coming
rapidly along the edge of the cliff with a shuffling, swaying
motion, and as she came she was continually rearranging the shawl
over her head and chattering volubly to herself in a hoarse,
coarse, raucous voice.&nbsp; The custode glanced at her as she
drew near and I thought he flinched.&nbsp; I do not know how I
knew it, but I was sure she was his wife.&nbsp; She was beside
herself with passion.&nbsp; She must have found out
something&mdash;something about some other woman.&nbsp; I felt as
I have felt at an Ibsen play&mdash;as though I were looking
through the keyhole into a room where dirty linen was about to be
washed.&nbsp; She shook and trembled all over like an express
train approaching a country station.&nbsp; Reason told me that
Peppino and I were safe, we were on the platform; nevertheless
accidents do happen and there was the poor custode on the
line.&nbsp; She drew up in front of us, and her draperies swirled
round her with the suddenness of her stopping.&nbsp; She became
silent and still, while she looked at me as though fixing my
appearance on her brain for this life and the next; she looked at
Peppino in the same way and at the custode.&nbsp; Then the
chattering began again and the restless rearranging of her shawl
over her head.&nbsp; Suddenly she turned, poured herself into the
cabin and exploded.&nbsp; It was not as with an earthquake, for
the walls <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>were left standing and the roof and
foundations were unshaken, and an earthquake, they say, seems to
last for an eternity, whereas this woman seemed to take but a
moment to complete her work of desolation.&nbsp; She pounced upon
something among the debris and laughed hysterically as she hid it
in her bosom.</p>
<p>The storm was over.&nbsp; She was transformed into a rather
beautiful and extremely graceful woman of about thirty.&nbsp; She
exchanged a few words of friendly chaff with her husband, smiled
at Peppino and bowed to me as she passed out, went up the path
against the moonlit sky and faded into the night.</p>
<p>All this was about a pack of cards.&nbsp; She had promised to
lend the cards to a neighbour that evening; her husband was to
have brought them home early in the day; he had forgotten to do
so and she had come to fetch them.&nbsp; So there was no murder
and no dirty linen, but the cabin had to be tidied.</p>
<p>What would this woman do had she the motive and the cue for
passion that I had supposed for her?&nbsp; If her husband ever
does entertain another lady in his cabin and his wife hears of
it, I hope I may not be in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; But if I were
to be there and to witness the crime, omert&agrave; would forbid
me, as a good Sicilian, to say anything about it.&nbsp; I should
have to forget the claims of justice and go to prison, if
necessary, rather than give such information as might lead to the
conviction of the person or persons guilty.</p>
<p>Lastly, there was the lady in the restaurant-car&mdash;but
perhaps she ought not to be included in the list.&nbsp; Let her
have the benefit of the doubt and a chapter to herself.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV<br />
THE CARDINALESSA</h3>
<p>One day, as I was travelling through the island by rail, I
lunched in the restaurant-car and divided my attention between
the colazione, the view and the other lunchers.</p>
<p>At the table in front of me sat three gentlemen; beyond them,
at a separate table, sat a distinguished-looking lady, quietly
but well dressed in foamy white musliny stuff, with a good deal
of lace and a few touches of pale green.&nbsp; She had a lovely
hat and a veil, which she wore in such a way that I thought how
well she would look in a motor-car.&nbsp; She did not appear to
be much over thirty, and she was alone except that she had a
little dog, whom she fed from her plate and who was evidently
very fond of her.&nbsp; She was not strictly beautiful, her face
depended for its charm more on its expression than on the
regularity of its features, but there was about her a certain
indescribable combination of dignity and vivacity that was
curiously attractive, and that soon attracted the three
gentlemen, who, I presently became aware, had entered into
conversation with her.&nbsp; Possibly they had asked the waiter
to introduce them while I was looking out of the window.&nbsp;
Certainly they cannot have met her before, because I heard them
ask her her nationality, and she told them that her father was an
Italian, a native of Rome, and that her mother was French.&nbsp;
And where was she going?&nbsp; To some place whose name I did not
catch.&nbsp; Then she must change at the junction.&nbsp; Yes, but
there would be no difficulty because she was accustomed to
travelling, she had travelled in China, India, Egypt and
America.&nbsp; No doubt she was gifted by nature with that happy
temperament which <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>enables its possessor to make
friends easily, and her extensive travels had provided
opportunities for its cultivation.&nbsp; I supposed the three
gentlemen to be accountants or advocates or perhaps engineers;
but I thought from her manner that she would have been just as
much at her ease if they had been carabinieri.&nbsp; I heard her
tell them she was twenty-two; she must have been very young when
she began her travels.</p>
<p>While the waiter was making out our bills, one of the
gentlemen begged her to grant him a favour.&nbsp; She smiled in
her frank open way as an encouragement to him to name it, and he
declared that he should consider it an honour if she would permit
him to pay for her luncheon.&nbsp; The lady accepted his
generosity, and granted his request with a smile of such queenly
condescension that I had a vision of great Elizabeth stepping
upon Raleigh&rsquo;s cloak.</p>
<p>Presently this gentleman went and sat by himself at a table
for two and the lady joined him.&nbsp; This appeared to me a
little odd; he might just as well have sat at her table, or have
invited her to sit at his with the other two gentlemen, there was
room and it would have been less marked.&nbsp; But they seemed to
prefer to start a little colony of their own, as it were, on
neutral ground.&nbsp; The gentleman made another proposal: A
glass of wine?&nbsp; With pleasure.&nbsp; So the waiter brought
it, and then the lady accepted a cigarette.</p>
<p>At the junction the lady and the gentleman both got out, and I
saw him help her into her train, which started first for the
place whose name I had not caught.&nbsp; Then he got into his
train, which was labelled &ldquo;Castellinaria,&rdquo; and I went
on without changing.&nbsp; A few days later, however, I returned
to the junction, changed there and followed the accountant to
Castellinaria, where I was going to see my friend Antonio, who
happened to be engaged there on an engineering job.&nbsp; In the
evening I told him about the lady in the restaurant-car.&nbsp; He
laughed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this lady is a particular friend of mine.&nbsp; She
is <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>often here, she returned two days ago and told me all
this herself, only last night.&nbsp; If you would like to make
her acquaintance I will take you to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we went to her hotel, which was not the Albergo della
Madonna.&nbsp; She received us in her bedroom, for which she
apologised charmingly&mdash;so charmingly as to make it appear
the most natural thing in the world to be received by her in her
bedroom.&nbsp; She remembered seeing me in the train, and begged
me to sit down.&nbsp; She had a visitor&mdash;a gentleman.&nbsp;
It was the gentleman who had paid for her luncheon in the
restaurant-car.&nbsp; I was introduced, and he was, as I had
supposed, an accountant.&nbsp; The lady was less elaborately clad
than on the occasion of our previous meeting.&nbsp; Just as her
other costume was precisely what it should have been for a
restaurant-car, so this was precisely adapted to her present
surroundings.&nbsp; She evidently understood dress.&nbsp; And
very pretty it was to see her busying herself about the room,
entertaining her guests and playing with her little dog.&nbsp; He
was not the only little dog she had ever had.&nbsp; Her previous
companion, who had been given her by a Neapolitan gentleman,
died, and she wept for six weeks and was inconsolable until
another friend gave her this one.&nbsp; She thought first of
calling him Vesuvio, which was the name of his predecessor, but
could not bring herself to do so.&nbsp; Then she had the
inspiration to call him Etna, which suited him better, because he
was a trifle bigger; it was also a kind of complimentary
reference to her first love.&nbsp; While she told us this she was
making coffee with a spirit lamp on the chest of drawers.&nbsp;
She had a speciality for making coffee, and really it was quite
drinkable.</p>
<p>She gave us the story of her life.&nbsp; She was the niece of
a cardinal, in whose person were accumulated all the apostolic
virtues, and her mother was a French lady of noble birth and
almost incredible beauty, who, when Mary, or Mery as she prefers
to write it, was about two months old, married the
cardinal&rsquo;s coachman and had eleven more <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>children.&nbsp; When one draws a conclusion from
insufficient data, it is always satisfactory to discover, as one
too seldom does, that one was right.&nbsp; I had been right about
the gentleman being an accountant, and here I was right again in
my surmise that the lady was exceptionally highly connected, so
highly that one could overlook her mother&rsquo;s
m&eacute;salliance with the coachman.&nbsp; Her uncle was only a
bishop at the time of her birth, he became a cardinal soon after
Mery&rsquo;s mother married the coachman, and then he forced the
coachman to legitimise Mery, and in this way the coachman became
Mery&rsquo;s legal father; and all this was part of a scheme to
accelerate the ecclesiastical preferment of her uncle.&nbsp; Ah!
but he was an ambitious man and aspired to the throne of S.
Peter.&nbsp; His scheme failed, however, owing to the wicked
intrigues of the Jesuits.</p>
<p>Parts of this might have borne, I do not say amplification,
for it was quite long enough, but a word or two of
elucidation.&nbsp; I have no doubt Mery would have been quite
ready to explain everything, for she had nothing to conceal and
the subject would have done as well as any other to display her
feminine charm, but I did not interrupt, because I have observed
that when a thorough woman of business undertakes to elucidate a
point of law, she does it so much in the manner of Mrs. Nickleby
that she not infrequently leaves it more obscure than she finds
it.&nbsp; Mery did not expressly say she was a woman of business,
she, in fact, disclaimed any such pretension, but she did it with
a delightful mock modesty that forbade us to take her words
literally.</p>
<p>No expense was spared over Mery&rsquo;s education.&nbsp; She
was sent to a convent at Marseilles and the nuns were very kind
to her, not because of her ecclesiastical connection, but because
they were holy women with large and noble hearts.&nbsp; Before
her education was completed, however, she was sent for to return
home, and oh, what a home it was!&nbsp; Her mother&rsquo;s health
had broken down because the cardinal beat her, her legal father
drank instead of protecting his wife, the younger children were
uncared-for and the elder <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>children,
though they were growing up, had not Mery&rsquo;s business
capacity and powers of management.&nbsp; She put her shoulder to
the wheel, did the marketing, the cooking and the cleaning; she
washed and mended the children&rsquo;s clothes and saw to
everything.&nbsp; She hated the life, but woman was born to
suffer and she did her duty.</p>
<p>In time her next sister married a music-hall singer&mdash;I
should say a dramatic artist.&nbsp; Mery, who was now entering
upon the heyday of her youth and beauty, was naturally introduced
to the friends of her sister&rsquo;s husband.&nbsp; Every man in
the company fell in love with her; all the bachelors proposed,
and without her natural firmness, reinforced by the teaching of
the holy nuns, she could scarcely have escaped matrimony.&nbsp;
There was another thing that helped to save her&mdash;she was
waiting for her anima gemella.&nbsp; I may here say that her
anima gemella has not yet crossed her path and that her real age
is twenty-seven.&nbsp; She told us this in confidence and it is
not to go any further.&nbsp; For people in restaurant-cars she is
any age she thinks proper at the moment, they do not matter, but
she will never deceive her friends.</p>
<p>Her sister&rsquo;s husband was a man of real insight; he
divined that Mery was a heaven-inspired dancer, and devoted
himself to the development of her genius.&nbsp; She did not say
he had taught her to dance; she said he encouraged and developed
her natural genius for dancing.&nbsp; She made her debut with a
success which the newspapers declared to be even more
&ldquo;phenomenal&rdquo; than that which attends the debut of
every artist.&nbsp; Engagements followed, and soon she was
dancing practically all over the globe, creating a furore
wherever she went and leaving the younger children&rsquo;s socks
to wash and darn themselves.&nbsp; Her mother was too ill and her
legal father too drunk to know what she was doing or where she
was doing it, but His Eminence heard and was so much scandalised
that when she danced into the Eternal City the doors of the
Vatican were closed to her.&nbsp; Cardinals are delightful men,
<!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>most of them&mdash;and Mery knows because she is on
terms of intimacy with every member of the College&mdash;but too
frequently they have a fault; they do not understand the artistic
temperament.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if her uncle could have heard
the cheers that greeted her in Shanghai and New York, and the
encores that called her back in Cairo and Calcutta, if he could
have seen the flowers that choked the wheels of her carriage in
St. Petersburg and the diamonds that were showered upon her in
Brazil, even his commonplace heart must have been moved.</p>
<p>She did not dance for us because, it seems, they do not dance
when they are resting, which was perhaps the psychological
reason, but there was also a geographical reason in the want of
space, for the room was small and contained, besides Mery and
Etna in one arm-chair, another arm-chair and two ordinary chairs
occupied by her visitors; also there was the chest of drawers on
which she had made the coffee and all such other articles of
furniture as one usually sees in a hotel bedroom, including two
beds.&nbsp; The extra bed was there because Mery was, she
confessed it, of luxurious habits and in the hot weather liked to
be able to change and finish the night in a cool bed.</p>
<p>Here there came a pause, not that she was exhausted, but
something had happened about the little dog, who required
attention.&nbsp; When Etna&rsquo;s business had been settled I
thought it might be tactful if I suspended the inconvenience, as
they say, so I asked Antonio whether we ought not to go and we
begged leave to retire.&nbsp; She wished us good night in her
frank, open way, thanked me for my visit, inquired how long I was
staying in the town and concluded with the hope that I would call
again, she never went out, so I should be sure to find her at any
time.&nbsp; It should not be Addio, it should be Arrivederci.</p>
<p>There are few places where I am more at home than I am in
Castellinaria, but as I had come there this time expressly to see
Antonio he considered it his duty to look after me; he was
engaged next day, however, so he deputed <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>two of his
friends to amuse me, and they invited me to come for a drive to
the lighthouse.&nbsp; On the way, one of them said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Antonio took you yesterday to pass an
intellectual evening with the cardinalessa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a charming
woman and what a strange life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They agreed, somewhat coldly as it seemed to me, and they
rather markedly refrained from developing the subject I had
offered them; but they proposed a counter subject.&nbsp; In a few
days it would be Mery&rsquo;s onomastico and they were going to
send flowers.&nbsp; I should be in Palermo, would not I send her
a message on a picture post-card?&nbsp; Of course I would.&nbsp;
So between us we composed it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Auguri per l&rsquo; onomastico.&nbsp;
Ringraziamenti per la serata intellettuale e per il
caff&egrave;.&nbsp; Saluti&mdash;non pi&ugrave;, per timore di
ingelosire nostro amico Antonio.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Devotissimo suo Enrico. <a
name="citation183"></a><a href="#footnote183"
class="citation">[183]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the address:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">All&rsquo; Eminentissima Cardinalessa</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Mery So-and-So</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Albergo dell&rsquo; Allegria</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Castellinaria</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I chose a card with a picture of St. Peter&rsquo;s; this
seemed more appropriate than una ballerina qualunque, which I
might have had for the same money, because her onomastico was the
8th September, the birthday of the Madonna, and it was her uncle
who had given her the name of Mery and had himself baptised
her.</p>
<p>I left Castellinaria next day with the card in my pocket ready
to be posted on the 7th September, and went to Palermo, where I
know a young doctor.&nbsp; I told him all <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>about it
and showed him the post-card.&nbsp; When he saw Mery&rsquo;s real
name he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that woman!&nbsp; Why, I know her quite well.&nbsp;
She was here with a friend of mine, who asked me to attend her
professionally&mdash;I mean in my professional capacity.&nbsp;
Oh! nothing serious, but we had to communicate with her people
and I know all about her.&nbsp; She is not a normal woman.&nbsp;
Of course, that rigmarole about the cardinal is all
nonsense.&nbsp; She is the daughter of a fisherman of
Siracusa.&nbsp; She did dance here once for a few nights, but
only at the Biondo, and no one noticed her, she was in one of the
back rows of the ballet.&nbsp; Did they tell you why she returned
to Castellinaria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had said nothing about it, and my doctor, not being a
friend of Antonio and therefore not bound by any ties of
omert&agrave;, gave me an account of it.</p>
<p>It happened a few months previously: Mery was living in
Palermo in a hotel, and her room had a balcony; the next balcony
belonged to a room occupied by a young lady and her family, and
the young lady was engaged to an officer.&nbsp; One day Etna
strayed on to the neighbouring balcony and behaved in a manner
that displeased the young lady whose betrothed complained to the
proprietor and Mery was requested to leave.&nbsp; She, of course,
saw that all this about her dog was merely a casus belli
concealing a conspiracy to insult her, and indignantly refused to
go.&nbsp; Next day, while the officer was sitting with his
friends outside his usual caff&egrave;, Mery happened to pass on
her way to buy a stamp and post a letter.&nbsp; She spoke to the
officer, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think a lot of yourself, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer requested her not to address him, whereupon,
taking the law into her own hands, she went up to him and made a
hole in her manners by scratching his face.&nbsp; A crowd began
to collect.&nbsp; Mery permitted herself the use of an
expression.&nbsp; It was a Sicilian word, my doctor told me what
it was and also its meaning; it appeared to me <!-- page 185--><a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>rather
silly than offensive, but he assured me that it is never used
except by people of the very lowest class.&nbsp; Mery then made
more holes in her manners, reducing them to the condition of one
of her father&rsquo;s fishing-nets, and was attempting to do the
same with the officer&rsquo;s face when the crowd interfered;
Mery was hissed and handed over to the police, who prepared her
papers, took her to the railway station and turned her out of the
town.</p>
<p>Incidents such as this, by showing Mery that Sicily is no
longer being misgoverned by foreigners, may in time, perhaps,
teach her not to distrust professional justice.&nbsp; They also
may in time, perhaps, teach travellers not to trust to
conclusions based upon insufficient data about
distinguished-looking ladies in restaurant-cars.</p>
<p>But I sent her the post-card all the same.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br />
THE CORPORAL</h3>
<p>One makes friends rapidly in Sicily.&nbsp; I made friends for
life with all the coast-guards during three or four hours which I
spent with them in their caserma.&nbsp; The corporal was the most
demonstrative, and after I returned to England we exchanged
post-cards for some months.&nbsp; Then he suddenly left off
writing, and I drew the conclusion that it is as easy to unmake
friends as to make them.&nbsp; But I was wrong.&nbsp; After four
and a half years of undeserved neglect I received another
post-card:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the death of one of my sisters and the
occurrence of several other family troubles I have not been able
before this day to write and assure you of the great affection
which I continue to nourish towards you.&nbsp; For this I beg
your pardon and your indulgence.&nbsp; I should have much
pleasure in writing you a long letter and in telling you many
things.&nbsp; Do you permit me to do so?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>I gave the required permission, and presently received
the long letter&mdash;much too long to be reproduced, but
amounting to this:</p>
<p>That he was sorry to hear I had had a cold, and wished he
could have had it instead; we could only hope that heaven would
give me good health for a hundred years; that he was now writing
the long letter about which there had been delay in consequence
of his having been away at home on leave when the necessary
permission reached him; that he had no words in which to express
his joy at hearing that I was soon coming to Sicily, as it was
now sixty-three months since he had been in my presence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Year after year and I have not seen you, spring after
spring and I have not seen you, autumn after autumn and I have
not seen you, and I have always looked for your coming and have
not seen you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on to say that the young lady to whom he was engaged
was a beautiful and honest girl, well educated and of a superior
but unfortunately poor family.&nbsp; He was longing for the day
when he might introduce her to me, for he had now been engaged
over four years, and his misery was that he did not know when
they could be married.&nbsp; He was thirty-five, and had been in
service fifteen years and a half; on attaining forty he would be
able to retire from the service and marry, but in the meantime he
was losing all his youth under military discipline; he had
applied for a permanent government post which might be given him
at any moment, and then he could retire from the coast-guard
service and return to his business; he was a carpenter by trade,
and there would then be no obstacle to his marrying.&nbsp; And
sometimes he was in despair because he could marry at once if
only he could deposit 8000 francs&mdash;a sum that was beyond his
means.&nbsp; He saw no way out of his trouble.&nbsp; He had been
very unfortunate ever since he was born, and supposed he should
continue to be so until he died; but he had always been
economical, and had saved about half the <!-- page 187--><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>sum
required; if only he could get the remaining 4000 francs it would
be a great good fortune, and in a few days he hoped to send me
his photograph together with that of his young lady.</p>
<p>I replied congratulating him on his engagement and regretting
that it was not in my power to help him to hasten his
marriage.&nbsp; Even if there had been any reason why I should
help him I should not have contemplated mixing myself up with the
regulations regarding the marriage of coast-guards made by a
friendly nation.&nbsp; If one were to begin, it would take a
great deal of money to go round Italy endowing all the
coastguards who want to marry; not that he had asked me to do
this, he had not even asked me to help him, but it is as well to
be prepared for what seems likely to happen next, and I was using
a sanctified form of refusal.</p>
<p>In his reply he did not mention the subject; he said he had
been transferred to Castellinaria and had been promoted.&nbsp; He
was now Caporale Maggiore.&nbsp; I did not know before that
coastguard corporals, like musical scales and Hebrew prophets,
could be either major or minor.</p>
<p>I again congratulated him, and hoped his promotion might help
to hasten his marriage.&nbsp; Next time I was at Castellinaria I
asked Peppino where I should find the caserma of the Guardia di
Finanza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in the church,&rdquo; said Peppino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What church?&nbsp; Not the duomo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; this other church where is no longer the praying
and they shall enchant no more the Glory of the Mass with music
and the bells are not ringing and there is the cortile near the
sea.&nbsp; It is not very long far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I knew he meant the disused church of S. Maria
dell&rsquo; Aiuto which I had often admired.&nbsp; I called there
the following day about three in the afternoon and inquired for
the corporal.&nbsp; His comrade who let me in took me along two
sides of a beautiful cloister, with sculptured marble columns,
and upstairs into the barber&rsquo;s shop, where we <!-- page
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>found the corporal with a towel round his neck being
shaved.&nbsp; He was so surprised to see me that I was afraid
there would be an accident, but the barber was clever and nothing
serious happened.&nbsp; After the shaving he took me into the
dormitory, which extends all along one side of the cloister on
the first floor with windows looking on the grass and flowers of
the cortile on one side and over the sea on the other&mdash;very
fresh and healthy.&nbsp; Some of his comrades, who had been on
duty all night, were sleeping in their beds, other beds were
empty, and their owners were blacking their boots and polishing
their buttons.&nbsp; He told them to entertain me, which they did
while he finished his dressing.&nbsp; He then returned and
proposed taking me out.</p>
<p>As we went along he asked whether he might take me to see his
young lady.&nbsp; I was surprised to hear she was in the town,
knowing it was not her native place, and asked whether the
remaining 4000 francs had dropped from heaven.&nbsp; He replied
that he was still waiting.&nbsp; He was to have a month&rsquo;s
leave soon, and intended to take the girl to his home and
introduce her to his family; in the meantime he had hired a room,
and it was very expensive&mdash;twenty francs a month, in the
house of most respectable people.&nbsp; I foresaw complications
when they should arrive at home, at least I thought the journey
might provoke remark among the friends of the family, but I said
nothing, and we went to the house of the respectable
people.&nbsp; Here I was introduced to the fidanzata, whose name
was Filomena, and who appeared to be, as he had said, rather
above him in station and of refined and lady-like manners.&nbsp;
She was embroidering the top part of a sheet&mdash;the part that
is turned down and lies over the pillow when the bed is
made&mdash;no doubt for her trousseau.&nbsp; The design had been
traced and traced again from the tracing so often that it was
difficult to say what it represented.&nbsp; There was a
balustrade of columns like those that were taken from old Kew
Bridge and sold to support sun-dials; there were cauliflowery
arabesques, and among the spiky foliage there were <!-- page
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>meaningless ponds of open-work made by gathering the
threads of the linen together into wonderful patterns.&nbsp; In
the middle of all this stood one who after a few more tracings
will have quite lost the semblance of a woman; the five fingers
of her hands and the five toes of her feet had already become so
conventionalised that all one could be sure of was that there
were still five of each.&nbsp; The corporal said that this
monster was Helen gazing out to sea from the topless towers of
Ilium.&nbsp; She was really looking the other way, exhibiting to
the spectator all that remained of the face that launched the
thousand ships of which half a dozen were shown riding at anchor
behind her back.&nbsp; I did not venture to criticise, because
the corporal knew all about it, having seen the <i>Story of
Hector</i> done by the marionettes.&nbsp; Filomena was
embroidering this most beautifully; I should say that the
needle-working of it was as much above all praise as the design
of it was beneath all blame.</p>
<p>Most of the room was taken up by a bed large enough to hold
three or four Filomenas without crowding, and upon it lay a
mandoline and a guitar.&nbsp; The corporal called for music;
Filomena cheerfully complied, left her broidery-frame, and took
up the mandoline, whose only title to be considered a musical
instrument is that Mozart uses it for the pizzicato accompaniment
which Don Giovanni plays while he sings &ldquo;Deh
Vieni.&rdquo;&nbsp; Filomena, knowing nothing about Mozart, used
her mandoline for the delivery of a melody which she performed
with great skill, though it was but a silly tune and sounded
sillier than it was because of the irritating tremolo.&nbsp; It
was like her embroidery&mdash;very well done but not worth
doing.&nbsp; She had been taught the mandoline by the nuns, who
had also taught her needlework.&nbsp; I expected the corporal to
accompany her on the guitar; he admitted that he was passionately
devoted to music, but excused himself from performing on the
ground that he had not studied it.&nbsp; This is not usually put
forward as an objection; the rule is <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>for them to
play and tell one, unnecessarily but with some pride, that they
are doing it all by ear.&nbsp; And in their accompaniment they
show themselves to be artists of the school that preaches
&ldquo;Simplify, simplify, simplify&rdquo; in that they exclude
all harmonies except those of the tonic, dominant and
sub-dominant.&nbsp; But they make the mistake of not being
careful always to play each in its right place; they carry their
simplifying process to the length of using their chosen harmonies
in regular order, one after the other, two bars each&mdash;it may
come right and it may not, and when it does not the resulting
complexities ruin the simplicity.&nbsp; This sort of thing might
become unbearable, but I know how to escape from people of the
corporal&rsquo;s class without being rude.&nbsp; I do not tell
them I have another engagement&mdash;that is not accepted
because, as there is no time in Sicily, punctuality is not
recognised.&nbsp; If they have a proverb about it, it ought to
be, &ldquo;Never put off till to-morrow what can be done the day
after.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor do I say I have letters to
write&mdash;that only provokes discussion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought you had come all this way to see us, and now
you want to write to England!&nbsp; You can talk to your English
friends when you are at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The course is to say one wants to sleep; one need not sleep,
but no objection is made, and one is usually allowed to depart at
once.&nbsp; I have not ventured to try this among my aristocratic
friends, I doubt whether it would work with them&mdash;besides,
they disarm me by handing round tea&mdash;but with corporals I
employ it freely, and the knowledge that I can always get away in
a moment, even if I choose to remain, imparts to their company a
sense of freedom which I regret to say I have sometimes looked
for in vain in the educated drawing-rooms of the upper
classes.</p>
<p>Before Filomena could begin her third piece I put my method in
practice, and for once it did not work quite smoothly, but the
result was not unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Certainly I might sleep, said the corporal; but why go
away?&nbsp; He hoped I should dine with them.&nbsp; I might name
<!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>my own hour and, as for sleeping, there was the
bed.&nbsp; Besides, his brother was coming to dinner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to know my brother,&rdquo; said the
corporal; &ldquo;he is not like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Corporal, that is no
recommendation,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is he also a
coast-guard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; He is a dentist and very clever.&nbsp; He is
an artificial dentist and he had to work to learn his
profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose every dentist must learn his profession
before he is qualified.&nbsp; Dentists have to be made, they are
not like poets.&nbsp; No one is a natural born
dentist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had to work very hard.&nbsp; For a whole year he
went to the hospital every day four times a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clever dentist is a useful ally.&nbsp; I should like
to know him.&nbsp; I might want his help while I am here.&nbsp;
What is his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes!&nbsp; That will interest you, he has an English
name.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he said something that sounded like
&ldquo;He ran away&rdquo; with the &ldquo;r&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;w&rdquo; both misty.&nbsp; As I did not recognise it, he
wrote it down for me&mdash;&ldquo;Ivanhoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you send him your teeth,&rdquo; continued the
corporal, &ldquo;he will repair them and return them to you as
good as new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them are getting loose,&rdquo; I admitted,
&ldquo;but they wouldn&rsquo;t come out so easily as you think,
and how should I ever get them in again?&mdash;Oh, I see what you
mean, he is a dentist in artificial teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; When I say he is not like me, I mean
that he is a man of great learning, really well educated.&nbsp;
He is very clever.&nbsp; You will see him at dinner.&nbsp; I must
not keep you talking, you wish to sleep.&nbsp; There is the bed;
why not lie down?&nbsp; If only we were in my own house at
home&mdash;&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>There was the bed, certainly, if I could conquer my
bashfulness and make use of it.&nbsp; Filomena treated the
proposal as quite natural, and put the guitar and the mandoline
on the chest of drawers, though there would have been plenty <!--
page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>of room for them on the bed with me; she and the
corporal prepared to leave the room, and I accepted their
hospitality with excuses which I fancy I made with some realism
because Peppino had kept me up talking half the night.&nbsp; They
went away, I took off my boots, lay down on Filomena&rsquo;s bed,
and was asleep in a moment.</p>
<p>At about six o&rsquo;clock the noise of the corporal opening
the door woke me.&nbsp; He hoped he had not disturbed me, he had
been in several times to fetch things and had tried to make no
noise.&nbsp; I had known nothing about it.&nbsp; Ivanhoe had come
and was very hungry.&nbsp; Then he showed me the cupboard
containing the basin and water for me to wash, and told his
fidanzata we were ready for the dinner which she had been cooking
while I slept.&nbsp; He seemed to consider the room as his
instead of hers&mdash;but then it was he who was paying the
twenty francs a month.&nbsp; Still I had a sense as though there
was something wrong.</p>
<p>I was introduced to Ivanhoe, and we sat down to
Filomena&rsquo;s dinner, which was like her embroidery and like
her music&mdash;it was very well cooked, but the materials on
which her skill had been expended were not worth cooking, they
ought not to have been bought.&nbsp; The young lady was one of
those artists who think more of treatment than of subject.&nbsp;
The corporal, on the other hand, in the management of his
matrimonial affairs, had chosen a good subject but was treating
it in a way which my English prejudices made me think too
free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not asked after your cold,&rdquo; said the
corporal to his brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope it is
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite well, thank you,&rdquo; replied
Ivanhoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have cured it with a remedy that never
fails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could tell me what it is,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;You take a
pail of water and a piece of iron; you make the iron red-hot and
plunge it into the water; at first the water fizzles, but when
the iron is cold the water is still; you put the water into <!--
page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>bottles and drink one every day with your dinner.&nbsp;
It always cures a cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must try it,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t
think I shall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you know how to cure colds in England, where you
all live in a perpetual fog and everyone is so rich that they can
afford to make experiments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have poor people also in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ivanhoe knew better.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said,
smiling indulgently, &ldquo;that is your English modesty; there
are no poor people in your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you I have seen plenty.&nbsp; And as for
modesty, I don&rsquo;t care very much about modesty&mdash;not for
myself; I don&rsquo;t mind it in others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but you English are so practical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have great men in England,&rdquo; said the
corporal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chamberlain, Lincoln, you call him il
presidente, and Darwin and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interrupted Ivanhoe, &ldquo;and great
poets, Byron and Milton&mdash;il Paradiso Perduto&mdash;and that
other one who wrote the drama named&mdash;what is his name?&nbsp;
Gladstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of our poets have written drama,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What particular drama do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one&mdash;it is from the History of Rome,&rdquo;
replied Ivanhoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man kills his wife, but I do not
remember his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it Romeo?&rdquo; suggested the corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not Romeo.&nbsp; This was a black man.&nbsp; I read
that Giovanni Grasso acted it in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Amleto,&rdquo; said the corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was not,&rdquo; replied Ivanhoe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now I remember he was not black; he lived in
Holland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Holland?&rdquo; inquired the corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holland is in the north.&nbsp; The people who live
there are called Aragonesi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Filomena prepared the coffee, I asked the corporal
whether she allowed smoking in her bedroom.&nbsp; She did, so I
gave him a cigarette and he admired my case saying it was <!--
page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>sympathetic.&nbsp; I also gave Ivanhoe a cigarette, but
Filomena did not smoke.&nbsp; There is a prejudice against ladies
smoking in Sicily unless they wish to be considered as belonging
either to the very highest or to the very lowest class, and
Filomena is content to belong to her own class.&nbsp; So she
looked on while we smoked and drank our coffee.</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;When we were speaking of English poets just
now, you mentioned a name which we are more accustomed to
associate with politics, the name of Gladstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! politics!&rdquo; said Ivanhoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have now in England a struggle between your House of Lords and
your House of Commons, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied that I had heard something about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is civil war,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe, &ldquo;that is,
it would have been civil war some years ago, but people are now
beginning to see that it is intolerable that everyone should not
be allowed to have his own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I do not quite follow you,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;it is not
difficult.&nbsp; Your House of Commons is composed entirely of
poor men, so poor that they cannot afford to pay for
legislation.&nbsp; Your House of Lords is rich, and rich people
are egoists and will not pay; so the House of Commons is
angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not ask where all the poor Members of the House of
Commons were found in a country that had no poor people; Ivanhoe
was too full of his subject to give me an opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the House of Lords still continues refusing to pay
for legislation there will be no war, but the House of Lords will
be abolished&mdash;annihilated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Ivanhoe,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;what a head
you have for politics!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Politics are quite simple if one studies the
newspapers.&nbsp; I know all the politics of Italy, of France,
Germany, England, Argentina, Russia.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you read
the papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I read the papers, but I do not find our English
papers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>&ldquo;Perhaps they are not so well edited as
ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be the explanation,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They certainly do not state things so clearly and simply
as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you do not approve
of war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied that war was a &ldquo;terrible scourge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is worse,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a
survival of barbarism that men should make a living out of
killing each other.&nbsp; War must be abolished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will not that be rather difficult?&rdquo; I
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Soldiers
are the instruments of war.&nbsp; If there were no soldiers there
would be no war; just as if there were no mandolines there would
be no music.&nbsp; And the money we now pay to the soldiers could
then be distributed among the poor&mdash;an act pleasing to God
and the saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this did not suit the corporal who, being a coastguard,
had no sympathy with cutting down the pay of the army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better as it is,&rdquo; said the corporal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is better to pay the money to soldiers, who are earning
an honest living, than to pay it to poor people and encourage
them in their idleness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But soldiers are receiving money for making war
possible and that is not earning an honest living.&nbsp; There
must be no more war.&nbsp; Soldiers must be
abolished&mdash;obliterated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obliterated&rdquo; woke the corporal up
thoroughly.&nbsp; It was all very well to talk about annihilating
the House of Lords, which he had understood to mean demolishing
some palace, but the army was a body of men, and if we were to
begin obliterating them&mdash;why, he had friends in the army and
it would never do, because&mdash;and so on, with interruptions by
Ivanhoe, until Filomena began to grow restless about washing up
and I began to take my leave.&nbsp; I thanked her for her
charming hospitality and the corporal and Ivanhoe accompanied me
back to the Albergo della Madonna.&nbsp; On the way I said:</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;Please tell me, Corporal, you say that Filomena
is your fidanzata, but it seems to me you are as good
as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not married,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;but
she has consented to become the mother of my children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I understand that you have already taken steps to
ensure the attainment of that happy result?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he had, and that she was coming home with him in order
that the baby might be born there.&nbsp; His people, who
understood the sincerity of his nature and the purity of his
motives&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, indeed,&rdquo; interrupted Ivanhoe, &ldquo;my
brother has a heart of gold and we are all satisfied with his
conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Filomena&rsquo;s family,&rdquo; continued the
corporal, &ldquo;are suspicious and unfriendly and
dissatisfied.&nbsp; Her adorata mamma and all her aunts and
female cousins wept when she left home, and they are still
weeping.&nbsp; But what else could we do?&nbsp; She was getting
ill after waiting so long and could not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interrupted Ivanhoe, &ldquo;she was
becoming like Ettorina, and my poor brother also was
unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They admitted that the situation, though the best possible,
was not ideal.&nbsp; The corporal has to sleep at the caserma and
pretend to the authorities that he is a free bachelor, he can
only visit the mother of his future children in his spare
time.&nbsp; And this regrettable state of things had arisen in
consequence, or partly in consequence, of my respect for law and
order.&nbsp; I did not put it like that to him.&nbsp; I pointed
out that if I had sent the 4000 francs I should have been obliged
to deny myself the pleasure of coming to see him in Sicily.&nbsp;
He concurred and thanked me for my consideration.&nbsp; His
experience of life had already taught him that the same money
cannot be spent on two different objects, and he was grateful to
me for choosing the one which gave him the pleasure of making me
acquainted with his fidanzata.&nbsp; The 4000 francs from some
other source or the government appointment might drop into his
<!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>lap at any moment, and at the latest, he could
regularise his position in five years, when he should be forty,
by leaving the service, returning to the carpentry, marrying and
legitimising any children that might have been born.</p>
<p>So I said good-bye to the brothers, wished the corporal every
happiness and gave him my sympathetic cigarette-case as a
non-wedding present, or rather as something that by an enharmonic
change should become transformed into a wedding present on the
solemnisation of his marriage, and he swore to keep it till death
as a ricordo of our friendship.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Next morning Ivanhoe called upon me and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Signor Enrico, I am in want.&nbsp; Would it be
possible for you to lend me five francs till next
week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;My dear Ivanhoe, it distresses me to hear
you are in want and it lacerates my heart that you should have
made a request which I am compelled to decline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not ask for myself.&nbsp; It is for my
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind telling me, merely as a matter of idle
curiosity and without prejudice to the question of the five
francs, whether the mother of your children is your wife or your
fidanzata?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my wife.&nbsp; We have been married thirteen
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many children have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am expecting another in a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo.&nbsp; Of course that alters the situation.&nbsp;
Now suppose we settle it this way: Let us pretend that you ask me
to lend you three francs, one for each child; I refuse, but
propose, instead, to give you one franc on the faith of the new
baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you abandon all hope of ever seeing the one
franc again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>&ldquo;Make it two francs and I agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ivanhoe.&nbsp; One franc is quite enough for an
unborn baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I gave him one franc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and now there is one more favour I wish to ask of
you.&nbsp; Will you hold the new baby at the baptismal font and
thus do me the honour of becoming my compare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This did not suit me at all.&nbsp; I replied: &ldquo;My dear
Ivanhoe, let us forget all we have said since you told me you
were expecting another baby, let us return to your original
request and here&mdash;take four more francs.&nbsp; It will be
better for me in the end than if I become your
compare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think so,&rdquo; said Ivanhoe.</p>
<p>I had no doubt about it, so I gave him four more francs and
abandoned all hope of ever seeing them again; but I got my
money&rsquo;s worth, or part of it, in the shape of a registered
letter soon after my return to London; in English the letter runs
thus, and I was brutal enough to leave it unanswered:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Castellinaria</span>.</p>
<p>My most esteemed friend, Signor Enrico!</p>
<p>First of all I must inform you that my health is excellent and
I hope that yours also is good.&nbsp; I wish you all the
happiness that it is possible for anyone to have in this world
and I would that I could transport my presence into London so
that I might be with you for a few days and thus augment your
domestic joy.&nbsp; But there is one thing wanting&mdash;I allude
to money.&nbsp; So many misfortunes have happened to me in this
sad year that I have not the means to undertake a long
journey.&nbsp; I should be much obliged to you if you would
kindly forward me 300 francs, of which I am in urgent need as I
have to pay a debt.&nbsp; This money I will repay you immediately
the next time I have the pleasure of seeing you in Castellinaria
or, if you prefer it, I will promise to pay you in seven months
from this date by sending the money through the post; it is for
you to choose which course would suit you <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>best.&nbsp;
You will find in me an honest man.&nbsp; You will be doing me a
favour for which I shall be grateful all the rest of my life, for
you will be extricating me from a position of extreme
discomfort.&nbsp; The Padre Eterno will bless your philanthropic
and humane action and I shall have a memory sculptured on my
heart as long as I live.</p>
<p>I will ever pray for your health and for that of all your
family.&nbsp; The favour I am now asking I should like you to
grant during the week after you receive this letter.&nbsp; I will
not write more except to say that, relying on the goodness of
your heart, I thank you cordially and await your favourable
reply.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">With infinite salutations,<br />
I subscribe myself yours for life,<br />

class="pagenum">p. 203</span>EARTHQUAKE ECHOES</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER XVII<br />
TOT&Ograve; CARBONARO</h3>
<p>One morning, in the autumn of 1908, I was sitting in front of
one of the windows of the albergo looking out across the harbour
at the mountains of Calabria, waiting for coffee and thinking of
<i>Omert&agrave;</i>.&nbsp; I had been spending a week in Messina
with Giovanni Grasso and his company of Sicilian Players, and
<i>Omert&agrave;</i> was the play they had performed the
preceding evening.&nbsp; I remembered how at the end Giovanni had
staggered in mortally wounded and refused to give the name of his
murderer&mdash;though the audience guessed who it must have
been&mdash;and then how he had given his knife to Pasqualino, his
young brother, and with his last breath had spoken these words;
&ldquo;Per Don Tot&ograve;, quando avrai diciotto anni&rdquo;;
and I had left the theatre wishing I could see Giovanni as
Pasqualino grown up and executing the vendetta.&nbsp; Giovanni
now uses a revolver as being a nobler weapon, but when I was with
him in Messina it was a knife.</p>
<p>The big waiter brought the coffee and stood on my left, the
little waiter followed him, and stood on my right.&nbsp; During
the week I had often seen this boy who was not yet a real waiter,
he was learning his business by waiting on the waiters, and
hitherto I had respected the convention by which I was supposed
to be unaware of his existence, except that when he had made way
for me on the stairs we had exchanged greetings.&nbsp; I said to
the big waiter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is this little fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at him and saw by his smile of expansive <!-- page
204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>friendliness that he was pleased to be the subject of
our conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tot&ograve;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took my knife off the breakfast table and imitating
Giovanni, as well as I could, handed it to the big waiter
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Don Tot&ograve; when he shall be eighteen years
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was perhaps wrong, it was certainly risky to play with
edged tools in this way in a country where one ought not to give
a handkerchief as a ricordo lest one should be supposed to be
intending to pass the tears it contains.&nbsp; But I assumed he
had seen the play and, although the quotation was not exact,
expected him to recognise it, instead of which he was furious
with me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not to do that.&nbsp; Tot&ograve; is a very
good boy and I shall not accept the knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this so sternly that I made up my mind he could know
nothing about the theatre&mdash;he must be a foreigner who had
yet to learn that a Sicilian child&rsquo;s confidence is not
destroyed by a mere threat to stick a knife into him, the idea
that anyone is going to hurt him is too preposterous to be taken
seriously.&nbsp; Or perhaps he had invested all his imagination
in superstitious securities.&nbsp; Or perhaps I had acted better
than I knew and had seriously alarmed him.&nbsp; But I had not
imitated Giovanni&rsquo;s realism so closely as to deceive
Tot&ograve;.&nbsp; I looked at him.&nbsp; He was beaming all over
his face as he shook his head and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big waiter scowled and went away, abandoning the reckless
child to his fate.&nbsp; Tot&ograve; put his hand on my arm to
attract my attention and emphasise what he was going to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are at home, please will you send me a
postcard with a picture of London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my boy; I&rsquo;ll send you as many as you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>This is all the conversation I had with Tot&ograve;
before I left Messina, which I did that day, but we have
corresponded.&nbsp; On returning to London I sent him a card with
a view of Oxford Circus full of traffic and, not knowing his full
name, addressed it:</p>
<p style="text-align: right">A Don Tot&ograve;,<br />
Piccolo Cameriere all&rsquo; Albergo Trinacria,<br />
Messina.</p>
<p>He replied at once, thanking me profusely for the beautiful
view of what he called I Quattro Canti di Londra and promising to
send me some prickly pears as soon as they were at their best,
having heard that they do not mature in London.&nbsp; Presently I
sent him another post-card secretly hoping he would show them
both to the stupid big waiter.&nbsp; He replied at once and,
among other things, asked if I should like him to come to
London.</p>
<p>I never like them to come to London unless they are sure of
some settled employment, and even then I would rather see them in
their native surroundings; so I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, Tot&ograve;.&nbsp; Here we already have too
many Italians, Austrians, Swiss and Germans.&nbsp; They come
because they believe that the streets of London are paved with
gold, but too many of them find our streets guttered by the tears
of foreign waiters who have failed to find work.&nbsp; You had
much better stay where you are like a good boy, and I will come
to Messina and see you next autumn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then a basket arrived containing the prickly pears in a state
of pulp, exuding juice from every pore because he had not
attempted to pack them, and accompanied by a card wishing me a
Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 28th December, 1908, Messina was
destroyed by an earthquake.&nbsp; The newspapers particularly
mentioned that the Albergo Trinacria had fallen, killing everyone
who was sleeping there that night.&nbsp; I chanced a card to
Tot&ograve; asking whether he had escaped.&nbsp; On the 6th
January I received a letter from him; he had <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>evidently
not received my card, which was returned to me about eight months
later.&nbsp; This is a translation of Tot&ograve;&rsquo;s
letter:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Catania</span>,<br />
1 <i>Jan.</i>, 1909.</p>
<p>Egregious Signor Enrico,</p>
<p>You must have already heard of the destruction of
Messina.&nbsp; By a miracle I am saved, also my family, except
that I do not yet know the fate of two of my sisters, my father,
three nephews and one brother-in-law.&nbsp; My father was at
Reggio Calabria, which was also destroyed.&nbsp; The Albergo
Trinacria was not merely shaken down, it was also burnt.&nbsp; It
was my good fortune not to be on guard that night in the hotel,
otherwise I too should have died.&nbsp; The few who have escaped
have been brought to Catania naked, without a soldo.&nbsp; We are
sleeping in the Municipio, on the floor, with a rug, a piece of
bread and cheese and a glass of wine which the Municipio gives
us.&nbsp; They have made me a present of a shirt because, as the
earthquake was at five in the morning, everyone was asleep and
they escaped just as they were.&nbsp; You may imagine in what a
condition I find myself, in what misery, it is such that you will
excuse my posting this letter without a stamp, but I have not a
centesimo to send you the news of the disaster of Messina.&nbsp;
On the post-card which you sent me you speak of coming in the
autumn, but there will be no more coming to Messina.</p>
<p>Enough!&nbsp; I could tell you in detail of many misfortunes
that have overtaken me, but I have not the courage to write
more.</p>
<p>I send you my respects.&nbsp; You will pardon me for being
obliged to post this without a stamp.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Tot&ograve;</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He gave me an address in Catania to which I wrote, and he
replied 24th January from Naples, where he and his family had
been taken.</p>
<p>Then he left off writing and I thought I had heard the last of
him.&nbsp; In the spring of 1910 I went to Sicily again, and
within an hour of arriving at my hotel in Catania one of the
waiters came up to me and said in a friendly way:</p>
<p><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;Good day, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I do not
recognise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Tot&ograve;.&nbsp; Messina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not possible!&nbsp; You were only thirteen at
Messina, and how old are you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How have you managed to become five years older in
eighteen months?&nbsp; Is it an effect of the
earthquake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sixteen at Messina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did that stupid big waiter say you were only
thirteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! well, he is dead now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought of the fate of Ananias and said: &ldquo;Poor
fellow!&nbsp; Do you remember how angry he was when I wanted to
give him my knife and said those words from
<i>Omert&agrave;</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he was not really angry with you, he was only
pretending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tot&ograve;!&nbsp; Not really?&nbsp; Do you mean he
was acting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I thought you understood.&nbsp; He was
always like that, full of fun, not stupid at all.&nbsp; He was a
good man and very kind to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And poor
Tot&ograve;&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>So it was someone else who had been stupid, and I left off
thinking of Ananias and began to think of those eighteen upon
whom the Tower of Siloam fell.</p>
<p>Tot&ograve; told me that he was sleeping at home when the
earthquake woke him up, and that he and the others in his house
ran out naked as they were into the street and saw the house
fall; they were only just in time.&nbsp; His father, who was in
Reggio, was saved, but one of his sisters was killed with her
husband and three children.</p>
<p>This is all the conversation I had with Tot&ograve; in
Catania; next day on my inquiring for him they told me he had
caught cold and had not come to the Albergo.&nbsp; I left without
seeing him again and next time I was in Catania they told me he
had gone away and they did not know his address.&nbsp; Possibly
he has disappeared for ever, but it is <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>more
probable that, like other meteoric bodies, he will cross my path
again some day.</p>
<h3>TURIDDU BALISTRIERI</h3>
<p>Among the members of Giovanni&rsquo;s company whose
acquaintance I made during my week in Messina were two ladies who
acted under their maiden names, viz. Marinella Bragaglia and
Carolina Balistrieri; the first is married to Vittorio Marazzi
and the second to Corrado Bragaglia, Corrado being the brother of
Marinella.&nbsp; I also often saw in the theatre Turiddu
(Salvatore) Balistrieri, brother of Carolina and therefore
brother-in-law to Corrado and brother-in-law by marriage (or
whatever the correct expression may be and, if there is no
correct expression, then compare di parentela) to Vittorio and
Marinella Marazzi.&nbsp; He was just over eleven, not a member of
the company but, being at school in Messina, his sister had taken
him to stay with her for the week, and we became great
friends.&nbsp; I was thinking of him when writing about Micio
buying chocolate and story-books at Castellinaria in Chapter
XVIII of <i>Diversions in Sicily</i>.&nbsp; When Giovanni and the
company departed from Messina to continue their tour, Turiddu and
his younger brother, Gennaro, remained in Messina with their
professor and, as their mother, Signora Balistrieri, was touring
with another company in South America, they had no home to go to
for Christmas and remained with the professor for the
holidays.</p>
<p>On the 27th December, Giovanni and his company, after being in
Egypt and in Russia, arrived at Udine, north of Venice.&nbsp;
They heard nothing of the earthquake until the evening of the
29th December, about forty hours after the event, when the news
reached them in the theatre during the performance of <i>La
Figlia di Jorio</i>.&nbsp; The next day Giovanni and six of the
company started for Messina; they wanted to ascertain for
themselves the extent of the <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>disaster
and whether the earthquake had affected Catania, where most of
their relations and friends were.&nbsp; Among the six were
Corrado Bragaglia and Vittorio Marazzi, whose particular object
was to find out what had happened to Turiddu and Gennaro.&nbsp;
When the company came to London in the spring of 1910 Corrado
gave me an account of their adventures.&nbsp; They arrived in
Naples where they were delayed a day, which they spent in meeting
fugitives, but they heard no news of the boys.&nbsp; They reached
Messina on the 1st January and, taking a basket of provisions and
medicines, started for the professor&rsquo;s house, treading on
dead bodies as they walked through the falling rain and fearing
lest another shock might come or that at any moment some already
shattered house might fall on them.&nbsp; The professor&rsquo;s
apartments were on the first and second floors of one side of a
courtyard that stood between a street and a torrent; the front
doors of the different apartments opened into the court as in a
college building; the professor&rsquo;s side of the court was
nearest the torrent and did not fall, but the other three sides
of the court fell and the houses on the opposite side of the
street fell, so that the debris made it difficult to approach the
street door of the court and still more difficult afterwards to
approach the doors of the different sets of apartments.</p>
<p>They found the landlord of the house, and he showed them that
the professor&rsquo;s part of the house had not fallen and told
them that the professor and his family had escaped and, he
believed, had been taken to Naples or Catania, or&mdash;he did
not know where.&nbsp; This was satisfactory, at least they no
longer thought the children were buried in the ruins, but it did
not give much information as to their whereabouts.&nbsp; They
went to the station and got a permission to go to Catania.&nbsp;
The train was crowded with fugitives, some wounded, some unhurt,
and during the journey a passenger gave birth to a baby.</p>
<p>In Catania they asked of Madama Ciccia (i.e. Signora Grasso,
Giovanni&rsquo;s mother), who would certainly have <!-- page
210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>heard if the children had been seen in the city, but
she knew nothing.&nbsp; They sought out the boys&rsquo;
grandmother, the mother of Signora Balistrieri, but she was not
at home, she had deserted her house for fear of another
earthquake and had been sleeping in the piazza.&nbsp; They
inquired at the hospital and at the institutions where fugitives
had been taken.&nbsp; They advertised.&nbsp; They actually found
a professor from Messina with pupils, but it was not the one they
wanted.&nbsp; They went to Siracusa, to Malta, to Palermo, to
Trapani; they got no information and returned to Catania.&nbsp;
Then they were struck with remorse for not having entered the
professor&rsquo;s house in Messina&mdash;they had only spoken to
the landlord&mdash;the boys might be buried there after all,
alive or dead.&nbsp; They returned to Messina and entered the
house; it was all in confusion; they looked through it, but found
no trace of the children.</p>
<p>All this took them seven days, during which they scarcely ate
and scarcely slept.&nbsp; They knew that if the boys had really
been taken to Naples they were probably safe, and now they went
there considering that they had done their best with
Sicily.&nbsp; In Naples they inquired at the official places, at
the hospitals and at the offices of the newspapers where they
could see the lists of names before they were published.&nbsp;
They found nothing and their thoughts went back to Messina; they
wondered whether the children might perhaps have been crushed by
a falling house in the streets, and whether they ought to
return.&nbsp; In the evening they went to a caff&egrave; to read
the lists, and by chance took up a Roman paper.&nbsp; They could
hardly believe their eyes when they read the names of Turiddu and
Gennaro among those who had been taken to the Instituto Vittoria
Colonna in Naples.&nbsp; They went there at once, but it was
already late at night and the place was shut.&nbsp; Unable to
think of eating or sleeping they walked about the streets till
six in the morning, when they returned and were admitted.&nbsp;
They stated their business, inquired for the children, produced
photographs and, after a little delay, Turiddu <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>and Gennaro
came running to them naked.&nbsp; It took some days of red tape,
including a legal act whereby Corrado constituted himself their
second father, before they were allowed to remove the boys.&nbsp;
At last on the 11th January they took possession of them and
dressed them in the street with clothes they had bought.&nbsp;
Corrado had telegraphed to his wife and to the other relations,
and they left Naples and rejoined the company at Udine, where
they arrived on the 14th.&nbsp; One of the actors when he saw the
children fainted and Corrado was ill for days with a fever.</p>
<p>Turiddu wrote to me from Naples to tell me he was saved, and
by August, 1909, when I went to Sicily again, he had left
Giovanni and the company and returned to Naples, where I found
him and Gennaro with the professor and his family, living in two
rooms of an establishment where emigrants are put to wait for
their ships to take them to America.&nbsp; They told me their
experiences.&nbsp; In Messina the family had consisted of the
professor, his wife, his niece (a studentessa), Turiddu and
Gennaro with two of their school-fellows, one named Peppino, son
of a well-to-do dealer in iron bedsteads, and another named
Luigi, son of a well-to-do orange-merchant, who had gone to visit
his uncle for Christmas.&nbsp; There was also a servant girl who
had gone that night to stay with her people.&nbsp; The parents of
Peppino and Luigi were both killed in their houses; fortunately
for Peppino he had not gone home or he would probably have been
killed.&nbsp; Luigi also escaped because the house of his uncle
did not fall or, if it fell, it did not kill him.&nbsp; The
servant, who had gone home, was killed.</p>
<p>They puzzled me by their attempts to explain why the
professor&rsquo;s side of the courtyard did not fall.&nbsp; It
seems it was partly because, being near the torrent, it had been
built more strongly than the other three sides; that was not all,
there was also something about a Japanese gentleman who had
studied earthquakes at home and who had hurried to Messina,
visited the spot and declared that the direction of the shock was
from (say) east to west, had it been from <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>west to
east the side near the torrent would certainly have fallen.&nbsp;
It may have been north to south&mdash;my thoughts had wandered
again to the Tower of Siloam.&nbsp; Turiddu, however, had a
reason for not being killed in the earthquake; he is naturally
lucky because he was born with a caul; he keeps most of it at
home and speaks of it as his cammisedda, which is Sicilian for
camicetta, his little shirt.&nbsp; He carries a small piece of it
in his watch-case, and offered to give it to me as a ricordo, but
I thought he had better keep it all; it cannot be lucky to give
away any of one&rsquo;s luck.</p>
<p>While Turiddu was with Giovanni and the company touring in
North Italy, he wrote, by desire of his professor, a sort of
holiday task about the earthquake.&nbsp; He gave it to me
afterwards, when I saw him in Naples, and I have translated
it.&nbsp; The passages in square brackets are additions I have
made from information the family gave me in Naples.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">SUBJECT</p>
<p>Describe all that you saw before and after the earthquake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>It was an ugly winter evening and the last day of the
Christmas holidays.&nbsp; I was playing with nuts with my
companions.&nbsp; About six o&rsquo;clock we dined and, after we
had finished, we began to play at Sette e Mezzo Reale [a game of
cards].&nbsp; We re-charged the acetylene lamps, for we intended
to sit up late.&nbsp; The professor opened [the window and went
out on] the balcony to see what the weather was like; observing
that the sky was frightful and of a reddish colour, he said to
his wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Nunzia, listen to these few words and bear them
in mind: This is a fatal night, it is a horrible
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife asked, &ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the professor replied, &ldquo;Either we shall have some
kind of storm or there will be a great earthquake or a
deluge.&rdquo;&nbsp; To these words we paid no attention, but
went on with our game.</p>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock after midnight we extinguished the
acetylene gas and went to bed, where we immediately fell
asleep.</p>
<p><!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>At half-past five after midnight there came a great
earthquake.&nbsp; I and my companions began to cry and recommend
ourselves to God who can save from every calamity.</p>
<p>After the earthquake was over we dressed in haste and frenzy
and went out [into the courtyard], but we could not pass the
front door [into the street] because it was blocked with
ruins.&nbsp; Presently our professor crawled out through a hole
and we followed him.</p>
<p>In the piazza we saw sights that tore our hearts, and we wept
as we thought of those poor unhappy children left without parents
or relations.&nbsp; And we thanked God who had saved us from such
a great disaster.&nbsp; Every few moments there came more shocks,
and there were we weeping and recommending ourselves to the
Lord.</p>
<p>As day broke we saw many wretched creatures being dragged out
from under the heaps of rubbish and being put on carts or laid on
the ground.</p>
<p>We began to feel hungry and begged our professor to buy us
some bread, but he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no place where bread can be bought, we must
therefore take courage, climb back into the house and get a few
nuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[This re-entering the house was dangerous because it might
have fallen when they were inside, but they managed it in safety
and returned with some maccaroni and bread, also some nuts and
two sticks of dried figs which were there for the festa of
Christmas.]</p>
<p>We began to eat the food and, seeing some children near us who
also were hungry, were moved to compassion for their condition
and gave them each something.</p>
<p>In this way we supported life for two days, but on the third
day the food was finished.</p>
<p>[During these two days they were in the ruins of a
fish-market, which was better than being out in the open, but not
much because the roof was broken.&nbsp; They only had such
clothes as they had snatched up in their haste and these were wet
through and saturated with mud up to the knees.&nbsp; They caught
colds and the professor was ill for months.]</p>
<p>All day long, bodies were being extricated from the ruins and
we could hardly bear the stench; to make matters worse it was
raining, the houses were on fire, the air was heavy <!-- page
214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>with smoke and there were constant shocks of
earthquake.&nbsp; It seemed like the end of the world.</p>
<p>On the third day I went with our professor to the port to
inquire whether the survivors would be taken to Naples.&nbsp; The
captain replied &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; We returned to the
market and our path lay among the wounded and the dead.</p>
<p>When we had reached shelter our professor said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take courage and return into the house to bring
out some clothes and linen and the certificates of my
niece.&rdquo;&nbsp; We went to the house, but the door was jammed
by reason of the earthquake.&nbsp; While we were shaking it,
there came another shock.&nbsp; We remembered another door, which
we opened, we went in and found the certificates and brought away
all such other things as we thought likely to be useful for the
moment and gradually carried them down.&nbsp; Our
professor&rsquo;s niece made the things up into bundles and put
them on our shoulders and so, passing the heaps of dead bodies,
of rubbish and ruins, we went to the railway station.</p>
<p>Here they made us get into a second-class carriage, which we
supposed would start for Catania, and we had nothing to eat but
oranges, which were given us by a soldier.</p>
<p>[It must have been while they were in this carriage that
Corrado and Vittorio went to the station and took train for
Catania, passing quite close to them and not seeing them.&nbsp;
There were twelve waggon-loads of oranges which had come from
Catania before the disaster in the course of trade, and orders
were given that they were to be distributed among the
survivors.&nbsp; Thus the waggons were emptied and people could
be put into them.]</p>
<p>Opposite us was a waggon full of soldiers and sailors.&nbsp;
Our professor&rsquo;s niece called a soldier and begged him not
to forget us.&nbsp; He immediately brought us three loaves of
bread, five flasks of wine, three tins of preserved meat and some
sausage.</p>
<p>Imagine our happiness when we saw that meat after those days
of hunger!&nbsp; We drank the wine at once because we had nowhere
else to put it and the soldiers wanted their flasks back.&nbsp;
We were eating oranges all the time, because they gave us
plenty.</p>
<p>After we had been in this waggon two days, one of the
railway-men told us that there had come a German steamer which
would take us to Naples.&nbsp; We took with us some bread, <!--
page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>some oranges and a little salame which we had over, and
went to the port, where, fortunately, we found a boat which took
us to the steamer.</p>
<p>At five minutes past eleven on the sixth day as the steamer
departed from Messina, the professor, his wife and his niece
began to cry.</p>
<p>The German sailors prepared bread and also basins of soup with
pasta in it, and when the bell sounded at noon they distributed
the food among us all.</p>
<p>When we had eaten it, we went below to see whether the women
required anything.</p>
<p>At half-past four they gave us soup with rice in it and plenty
of meat.&nbsp; Then the captain ordered that the fugitives should
go below.&nbsp; We were taken into the second-class cabin which
was set apart for the women and children.</p>
<p>Next day when we arrived at Naples they would not let us
disembark till we had had coffee, after which we all collected
and were landed in boats.&nbsp; First, however, they made all the
men descend into one boat and in another boat all the women.</p>
<p>When we had disembarked at Naples they at once wanted all our
names and then took us to an institution called &ldquo;Vittoria
Colonna,&rdquo; where in order to restore us we were each given a
good cup of coffee and milk.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>While they were in Messina the children and the niece slept at
night, but the professor and his wife did not sleep at all, and
for two of the days the professor and his wife ate nothing and
drank nothing.&nbsp; They were able to collect drops of rain
water, especially when they were in the railway carriage where
they had a roof, and they sometimes <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>collected a
little wood and made a fire.&nbsp; Earthquake shocks were
continually occurring.</p>
<p>The professor is also an imbalsamatore and, as an example of
his skill, gave me a stuffed bird which I was to take to
London.&nbsp; He said it was a kind of quail, a bird that reposes
near Messina when migrating.&nbsp; His niece, the studentessa,
gave me as a ricordo a pin-cushion; on one side it has an
advertisement of a shop in Messina and on the other a picture of
a lady trying on a new garter, which has been bought at the shop
and which fits perfectly to the delight of her maid and the
astonishment of her grandmother.&nbsp; They had saved these
things after the earthquake.&nbsp; One does not look a gift-horse
in the mouth, but I have sometimes wondered whether the
buffo&rsquo;s Cold Dawn had followed the professor and the
studentessa in their flight and whispered to them that they had
saved the wrong objects.&nbsp; Still, a pin-cushion is always
useful.</p>
<h3>RAILWAY PORTERS</h3>
<p>Some years ago the station porter who attended to my luggage
at Messina gave me his name and address, saying that if I would
send him a post-card next time I came, he would meet me and look
after me.&nbsp; Since then I have passed through Messina once,
and sometimes twice, a year and he has always met me.&nbsp; I
wrote to him from London after the earthquake inquiring whether
he was alive or dead, but he did not receive my card till nearly
eight months later, after it had been returned to me and I had
sent it to him again.&nbsp; I had in the meantime heard, in an
indirect way, that he was one of the station porters who had
survived.&nbsp; In the August following the earthquake I sent him
a card to say I was coming by steamer from Naples, and he was in
a little boat in the port to meet me.</p>
<p>There was a difference in his manner and a new look in his
eyes.&nbsp; When he had been talking some time, I mentioned <!--
page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>it, and he admitted that he felt different since the
earthquake.&nbsp; His house fell and he lay buried in the ruins
with nothing to eat or drink and seriously wounded.&nbsp; A
friend came looking for him and after three days he was
extricated, restored to life and properly taken care of.&nbsp;
But his wife and child were killed and his home destroyed.&nbsp;
He has been born again naked into the world, no wonder there is a
strange look in his eyes.&nbsp; We were joined by his cousin,
another porter, who was seven days in the ruins, starved into
unconsciousness.&nbsp; When the soldiers rescued him they thought
he was dead, but they took him where the doctors gradually
brought him back to life.&nbsp; He did not mind the dying after
it had once set in, everything gave way to the indolent pleasure
of irresponsible drifting, but the restoration was a difficult
and exhausting business.&nbsp; He will be thought to be dead
again some day, and will be allowed to continue his sleep in
peace without any troublesome awakening.</p>
<p>I looked in the eyes of the men who were hanging about among
the temporary wooden sheds in the piazza in front of the station,
and saw in many of them the expression that was in my
porter&rsquo;s eyes, the expression that betrays those who are
the figli del terremoto, those who have been born again with the
earthquake for their second mother, and I remembered that the
same expression was in the eyes of Turiddu&rsquo;s professor in
Naples.&nbsp; I had supposed it to be normal with the professor,
but it was the first time I had seen him; now I understood that
it was not there before.&nbsp; They have not all this look.&nbsp;
Turiddu has not got it, nor has my porter&rsquo;s cousin.&nbsp;
The professor is sixty-two, Turiddu is only twelve and was able
to sleep.&nbsp; My porter is about forty-two, his cousin is not
yet thirty.&nbsp; Again, the professor had the responsibility of
his party; Turiddu had none.&nbsp; My porter has lost his wife
and child; his cousin is unmarried.</p>
<p>These two porters told me a great deal that I had read in the
papers in England; to hear it from them on the spot <!-- page
218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>made it more real, and especially to see their gestures
describing how the earthquake took the houses and worried them as
a terrier worries a rat.&nbsp; Few houses were not wrecked.&nbsp;
I pointed to one which I knew to be the Palazzo dei Carabinieri
at a corner of a street leading out of the station piazza, but my
porter replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are looking at a corner of it and can only see two
walls.&nbsp; The other walls and the floors have fallen.&nbsp; If
the shutters were open you would see the sky where the rooms
ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the other corner of the street used to stand the Albergo di
Francia, where I stayed once when all the other hotels were full
because the wind was so strong that the ferry-boat could not get
out of the harbour to take the travellers across the
straits.&nbsp; The albergo was lying in a heap on the ground; in
its fall it had crushed and killed and buried the young landlord,
Michele;&mdash;&ldquo;God rest his soul in heaven, so
merry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I uttered some banality about their having passed through a
terrible time.&nbsp; They accepted my remark as a final summing
up and said it was better not to talk about it.&nbsp; It was
evidently a relief to them to talk of something else.</p>
<p>Before Messina can be rebuilt on its old site, the ruins must
be cleared away and the disputes about the boundaries must be
settled, and this will take time.&nbsp; Meanwhile the people are
living in the wooden bungalows of a New Messina which is growing
up outside the old town.&nbsp; I spent two days there in the
spring of 1910 and again in 1911.&nbsp; The Viale San Martino is
the principal street.&nbsp; There are hotels, bookshops,
sweet-shops, tobacconists, jewellers, butchers, restaurants with
tables ready spread, and the lottery offices are open.&nbsp; Most
of the huts have no upper storey and some are no bigger than half
a dozen sentry boxes knocked into one.&nbsp; It is very
dusty.&nbsp; The boys are crying papers up and down the street,
there are barbers&rsquo; saloni and shops with silver-topped
canes.&nbsp; The earthquake <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>seems to be
forgotten in the intensity of the bubbling life.&nbsp; As I
passed the Municipio in a side street, I saw a wedding party
going in.&nbsp; One evening I went to the theatre and saw
<i>Feudalismo</i> with Giovanni Grasso, a homonymous cousin of
the great Giovanni, in the principal part and Turiddu&rsquo;s
mother, Signora Balistrieri, as one of the women.</p>
<p>The first time I was in Messina after the earthquake all this
was only beginning and many of the people were living in railway
waggons in the sidings, of which few now remain.&nbsp; It was
strange to see rows of railway carriages with curtains to the
windows and some with steps up to the door and a little terrace
outside with creepers growing over it.&nbsp; The cabins and the
waggons are supposed to be safe, because they would not crush
their tenants in another earthquake.&nbsp; But they do not
seriously fear another earthquake; Messina has been so thoroughly
destroyed that it must now be the turn of some other town.</p>
<p>I replied: &ldquo;Yes, the Veil of S. Agata preserved Catania
this time, but it may desert her next time as the Letter of the
Madonna deserted you last winter.&nbsp; By the by, what has
become of that miraculous Letter?&nbsp; Was it destroyed or did
anyone save it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not know and muttered something about
&ldquo;stupidagini,&rdquo; and perhaps there will be no need to
trouble oneself with any such thoughts when one is living the
life after death.&nbsp; Later on, in another part of the island,
I asked a dignitary of the Church, who had not been through the
earthquake, what had become of the Madonna&rsquo;s Letter and he
assured me that it had been preserved.&nbsp; I had pretty well
made up my mind that this would be his answer before putting the
question; but if the earthquake had destroyed Girgenti and I had
asked him about the letter from the Devil, which is said to be
preserved in the cathedral there, I should have expected him to
tell me that that letter had not survived the shock.</p>
<h3><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>GIUSEPPE PLATANIA</h3>
<p>In Catania I saw my friend Lieutenant Giuseppe Platania, who
was quartered in Messina during the winter of 1908-9.&nbsp; He
was away for Christmas and returned about midnight on the 27th
December and went to bed at two in the morning on the 28th.&nbsp;
He was awakened by the falling of a picture, which hit him.&nbsp;
He guessed the reason, covered his head with the pillows and lay
still, waiting.&nbsp; He had to wait fifty-seven seconds&mdash;at
least many people told me the earthquake lasted fifty-seven
seconds, but the recording instruments were broken, so it is not
certain how long it lasted.&nbsp; When the room left off rocking,
Giuseppe put out his hand for the match-box, but the table was no
longer by his bedside.&nbsp; He heard cries for help, and a man
who was sleeping in the next room came with a light, then he saw
that the floor of his room had fallen, but not under his bed,
which was in a corner.&nbsp; He and the man with the light
managed to get to the window and let themselves down into a side
street, but they saw no way out because the exit was closed by
the fallen houses.&nbsp; Their window was on the first floor and
they climbed back into the house, helped another man who was
there, got themselves some clothes and returned into the side
street.&nbsp; Here they felt no better off and were afraid of the
houses falling on them, but Giuseppe&rsquo;s soldier servant,
Giulio Giuli, a contadino of Nocera, appeared among them.&nbsp;
He had come to look for his master and crept through the ruins
into the side street.&nbsp; He told them that Messina was
destroyed, which they would not believe; everyone seems to have
supposed at first that the earthquake had only damaged his own
house.&nbsp; Giulio showed them the way out, and so they got into
the town and realised the extent of the disaster.&nbsp; If Giulio
had not come, Giuseppe and his friends would probably have been
destroyed by more houses falling into their narrow street before
they could have found a way out.</p>
<p>Giuseppe had changed his bedroom about ten days <!-- page
221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>previously.&nbsp; The house he used to live in was
completely destroyed, he showed me a photograph of its
ruins.&nbsp; His mother and his brother Giovanni, in Catania,
heard of the disaster, but could get no particulars because
communication was broken.&nbsp; Giovanni went to Messina to
inquire for his brother, not knowing where his new room was, but
he knew the number of his regiment.&nbsp; He stopped a soldier in
the street who was wearing the number in his cap and who told him
where to find Giuseppe.&nbsp; In the meantime Giulio had walked
about fifteen miles to Al&igrave;, whence he took the train to
Catania, told the mother her son was safe, and returned to
Messina to help in the work of rescuing victims.</p>
<p>Giuseppe directed his soldiers in the rescue work and
afterwards received a medal &ldquo;Per speciali
benemerenze.&rdquo;&nbsp; While at work they saw a hand among the
ruins and began to dig round it, all the time in fear lest the
disturbing of the rubbish might make matters worse for the victim
and for themselves.&nbsp; The hand belonged to a woman whose head
had been protected by being under a wooden staircase.&nbsp; She
showed no sign of life and it was already four days since the
disaster.&nbsp; They wetted her lips with marsala and poured some
into her mouth and thus restored her.&nbsp; Giuseppe told me that
nothing made more impression on him than seeing this
woman&rsquo;s breast begin to heave as life returned.</p>
<p>The soldiers had to shoot the horses and dogs for eating the
corpses, and the thieves for pilfering.&nbsp; The horses had
escaped from their stables, which were broken by the earthquake,
and the dogs had come in from the country.&nbsp; And besides the
pilfering they told me of other things the doing of which had
better be ignored by those who seriously cultivate the belief
that civilisation and education have already so transformed human
nature that all restraints may be safely removed, things which,
nevertheless, were done by human beings in Messina while the
houses were tottering during the closing days of 1908 and the
opening weeks of 1909.&nbsp; I inquired whether the townspeople
were themselves <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>guilty of these horrors and they
said: No.&nbsp; The bad things were done by people who came into
the city from the country, like the dogs, and across the straits
from Calabria to take advantage of the catastrophe.&nbsp; As my
friend Peppino Fazio in Catania put it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The earthquake was very judiciously managed; it killed
only the wicked townspeople; it did not touch the good ones, they
all escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giuseppe&rsquo;s brother, Giovanni Platania, is a scientific
man and a professor; he went often from Catania to Messina during
the early part of 1909 to study the behaviour of the sea during
the earthquake&mdash;the maremoto.&nbsp; He has embodied the
results of his researches in an opuscolo on the subject <i>Il
Maremoto dello Stretto di Messina del 28 Dicembre</i> 1908
(Modena.&nbsp; Societ&agrave; Tipografica Modenese, 1909).&nbsp;
It took him twelve hours to return to Catania from one of his
first visits; the journey in ordinary times is performed by the
express in two hours and a half.&nbsp; There was no charge for
the tickets because it was the policy of the authorities to empty
the town; in this way malefactors who escaped from the prison got
easily away.&nbsp; In the train was a woman who talked, saying
that no one could blame her for travelling to Catania free,
especially as she had not deserved to be put in prison&mdash;she
had been put there for nothing.&nbsp; There was also a man who
did not exactly say he was a thief, but he informed his
fellow-travellers that the bundle he had with him had been
confided to his care by the padrone of his house.&nbsp; There was
no reason why he should have told them this, no one had asked him
about his bundle, and Giovanni drew his own conclusions.</p>
<h3>GIULIO ADAMO</h3>
<p>In Trapani I talked with another friend, a doctor, Giulio
Adamo of Calatafimi.&nbsp; Communication was broken and it was
not until the evening of the 29th that they began to <!-- page
223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>know in Trapani that there had been an earthquake in
Messina.&nbsp; Giulio went with others by train to Milazzo and
the train could go no further.&nbsp; They continued the journey
by boat from Milazzo to Messina, where he arrived on the
30th.&nbsp; When they approached the city and saw the row of
houses facing the harbour where the Albergo Trinacria was, they
thought the disaster could not have been so very great.&nbsp; But
it was only the facciata that was standing, the houses behind
were down.&nbsp; There was great disorder, heaps of bodies, no
water to drink because the pipes were broken, and for the three
days Giulio was there they only had bread from Palermo and the
oranges which were in the railway-waggons.</p>
<h3>CEC&Egrave; LUNA</h3>
<p>In Palermo I talked with another doctor, Cec&egrave;
(Francesco) Luna, of Trapani, whose acquaintance I made many
years ago on Monte Erice when he was there as a student in
villeggiatura.&nbsp; In September, 1909, I found him in the
children&rsquo;s hospital at Palermo.&nbsp; As soon as news of
the earthquake reached the city, the <i>Regina Margherita</i> was
fitted out to help the wounded and Cec&egrave; went in her among
the doctors.&nbsp; When they arrived at Messina, they could
neither enter the harbour nor take anyone on board because they
had to obey orders.&nbsp; It was raining, the sea was rough and
covered with little boats full of fugitives, some unhurt, some
wounded.&nbsp; One boat contained a young man holding an umbrella
over his mother, who was wounded and lying on two tables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am strong.&nbsp; I can wait seven or eight days
without food, it is not for me, it is for my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cried and prayed till the orders came and she was taken on
board.</p>
<p>Cec&egrave;, who was put in charge of the taking on board of
the fugitives, ordered that the wounded were to be taken <!--
page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>first.&nbsp; He was somewhat surprised that this order
was attended to; it was so, however, the wounded were taken in
without confusion; but afterwards among the unwounded there was
confusion.&nbsp; There was a boy who tried to get on board first,
Cec&egrave; pulled the boy&rsquo;s cap off and threw it away,
intending it to fall in the sea, but it fell in another boat and
the boy went after his cap and gave no more trouble.</p>
<p>The earthquake was at about 5.20 a.m. on 28th December; the
<i>Regina Margherita</i> arrived at Messina at 8 a.m. on the 30th
December.&nbsp; As soon as Cec&egrave; landed, he began searching
with others and at 10 a.m. found, in a well-furnished house, a
woman dead in bed, killed by a beam which had fallen across
her.&nbsp; Under the beam, close to her body, lay a baby girl,
very dirty but alive and untouched.&nbsp; It was impossible to
say precisely when the child had been born, but certainly only a
few hours before the earthquake, just time enough for the midwife
to leave the house, for they found no trace of her.&nbsp;
Cec&egrave; took the baby to the steamer and gave it sugar and
water, and when they returned to Palermo they got it a wet-nurse
and it was baptised Maria in the children&rsquo;s hospital.&nbsp;
If one has an earthquake in one&rsquo;s horoscope, surely it
could not be placed at a less inconvenient part of one&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; New-born babies can live three or four days without
food; but if this child had not been born before the earthquake,
she would not have been born at all, and if she had been born
earlier, she would have died of starvation or exposure before she
was found.&nbsp; As it happened she was sheltered and her life
preserved by the beam which killed her mother.&nbsp; Maria was
adopted by a lady of Palermo, and in April, 1910, Cec&egrave;
told me he had lately seen her and she was beginning to walk.</p>
<p>Cec&egrave; had had twenty earthquake babies in his hospital,
all with fathers and mothers unknown, and, of course, other
hospitals were equally full.&nbsp; When I was at Palermo in 1909
he had only seven of the twenty, the rest having been taken away,
some by their fathers and mothers, others by <!-- page 225--><a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>people who
adopted them.&nbsp; Travelling back to England I saw in the
railway stations at Rome, Milan, and other places, frames of
photographs of unclaimed babies put up in the hope that they
might be recognised by chance travellers.</p>
<p>The <i>Regina Margherita</i> stayed at Messina one day,
loading, and then returned to Palermo with five hundred unwounded
and eighty-two wounded.&nbsp; Cec&egrave; remained in Messina,
searching, but joined the ship when she returned to Messina,
where she took up her station in port as a floating hospital.</p>
<p>He told me of a woman who was in the ruins, alive but unable
to move.&nbsp; Her daughter lay dead beside her.&nbsp; It was
raining, there was a dripping and she was getting wet.&nbsp; With
the morning light she saw it was not the rain that was wetting
her, but the blood of her husband and two grown-up sons who were
dead in the room above.</p>
<p>He told me of a law-student in Palermo, twenty-four years old,
engaged to a young lady who lived in Messina; this young man went
to pass his Christmas holidays with his betrothed.&nbsp; He was
not in the same house and the earthquake did him no harm; as soon
as it was over his first thought was for his fidanzata.&nbsp; He
got into the street and made for her house, paying no attention
to the cries that issued from the ruins.&nbsp; But, like a
wandering knight on his way to assist his lady and embarrassed by
meeting other adventures, he was stopped and forced to help in
searching a particular house, from which he extricated a
beautiful girl, nineteen years of age, unhurt.&nbsp; She would
not let him go till he had saved her mother.&nbsp; All the others
in the house were killed.&nbsp; Still the girl would not let him
go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you rich?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take this ring and tell me who you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the ring and after giving her all the information she
required was allowed to proceed.&nbsp; When he came to the <!--
page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>house of his betrothed he found that she and all her
family had perished.&nbsp; He returned to Palermo weeping.</p>
<p>Two months later he received a letter:</p>
<p>I asked if you were rich; you replied &ldquo;No&rdquo; and I
gave you my ring.&nbsp; You saved my mother and you saved
me.&nbsp; My mother has since died from the effects of the
shock.&nbsp; If you are free I am ready to marry you and I have
money enough for both.</p>
<p>On this they became engaged and after a suitable time intend
to marry.&nbsp; Cec&egrave; wanted to apologise for the
conventionality of this story, but I begged him not to trouble;
if unassisted nature were to be always original, the occupation
of poets and romancers would be gone.</p>
<p>In one house was a servant, a Roman woman; she was devoted to
a young lady of the family and all the family were buried in the
ruins, but the Roman servant was unhurt.&nbsp; She could get no
help, the house was on the outskirts of the city and such
passers-by as there were would not stop.&nbsp; She set to work
searching for her young mistress and incidentally saved the whole
family.&nbsp; It took her twenty-four hours; they were all
wounded and her young mistress was the last she found.</p>
<p>A woman kept a small shop opposite another shop kept by a man
who sold coal.&nbsp; The woman had saved money and the carbonajo
knew she had her money in her house.&nbsp; He entered the
woman&rsquo;s house after the earthquake, accompanied by another
malefactor.&nbsp; The woman&rsquo;s daughter was killed, but the
woman was under the ruins alive and they pulled her out.&nbsp;
She exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she did know the carbonajo quite well, or at least well
enough to know he was a bad man and to suspect his
intention.&nbsp; They asked her where her money was
concealed.&nbsp; She only repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They believed her, thinking she was confused by the shock of
the earthquake; this was what she intended, <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>otherwise
she feared they would have killed her.&nbsp; They threatened her,
and at last she told them where the money was, still protesting
that she did not know them.&nbsp; They took her money and then,
being afraid she might give the alarm and they might be caught
before they could escape, they pinned her down with a large piece
of the ruins on her left arm and departed, taking the risk of her
being rescued later and saying she had been robbed by unknown
men.&nbsp; She was rescued and brought to Palermo.&nbsp; In the
hospital she begged Cec&egrave; to put an end to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of living?&nbsp; My daughter is dead,
my arm is gangrened, my money is stolen.&nbsp; Let me die and
have done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cec&egrave; did not kill her, he chloroformed her and
amputated her arm.&nbsp; She gave information about the
carbonajo, who was arrested in Messina.&nbsp; His accomplice
escaped, but the woman got back her money and thanked Cec&egrave;
for amputating her arm instead of killing her.</p>
<h3>FUGITIVES AND VICTIMS</h3>
<p>At Caltanissetta they told me that the trains were bringing
fugitives from Messina all day and all night.&nbsp; The fugitives
were mostly naked and all very dirty, some with rugs, some with
cloaks, some with rags.&nbsp; A woman got out of the train
clothed, like Monna Vanna, in nothing but a cloak which a soldier
had given her.&nbsp; They asked her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want done for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her cloak and showed that she wanted
everything.</p>
<p>Another woman came with her daughter whose leg was broken and
they were both naked.&nbsp; The doctor said to the mother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help for my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To another destitute woman: &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>&ldquo;Shoes for my baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michele, a young man, was known to be in Reggio where he was
employed in the Municipio.&nbsp; His father went from
Caltanissetta to look for him and returned after four days,
during which he had searched for his son and suffered mental
anguish and physical discomfort.&nbsp; His friends went to the
station to meet him.&nbsp; He talked politics to them and asked
their opinion about the rotation of crops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Michele?&rdquo; they inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Michele,&rdquo; here he began to laugh:
&ldquo;Michele; yes, he is buried under the ruins of a house
three storeys high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could get nothing more out of him except laughter and
that Michele was lying under a house three storeys high.&nbsp; A
few months later, Michele&rsquo;s body was found, with no traces
of decay, brought to Caltanissetta and buried.&nbsp; Then his
friends wrote elegies in verse about him and handed them round
for approval.</p>
<p>Plenty of people went mad besides Michele&rsquo;s
father.&nbsp; The streets of Messina were full of mad
people.&nbsp; They told me of one who lost his wife.&nbsp; Within
a fortnight he married a widow whose husband had been
destroyed.&nbsp; This happy couple spent their honeymoon in
digging out the bodies of their previous spouses and having them
suitably buried.</p>
<p>When I say they married, a widow may not legally marry for ten
months after the death of her husband, but this couple married on
credit, as they call it.&nbsp; There were many fugitives who
found a temporary asylum in a prison in Catania and who similarly
married on credit, intending to return later and contribute to
the population of the new Messina.</p>
<p>There was a family living on the top floor of a house close to
the railway station near the port in Reggio.&nbsp; They were not
hurt, but they could not get down because the earthquake had
destroyed the stairs.&nbsp; The man made a rope of sheets, with
the help of which he carried his wife down, then he went up and
fetched his children one after <!-- page 229--><a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>another,
three or four children.&nbsp; He went up again to fetch his money
and while in his room the house fell with him, killing and
burying him in the ruins.&nbsp; But he had saved his wife and
children.</p>
<p>They told me of a victim, pinned down in a cellar, unable to
rise; a chicken, whose coop had been broken, escaped and passed
near; the victim caught the chicken, killed it, plucked it and
ate it raw.&nbsp; They told me of others, not pinned down but
imprisoned in rooms, who ate what they found in
cupboards&mdash;oil, biscuits, salame, uncooked maccaroni.&nbsp;
These victims were saved and lived to recount their
sufferings.&nbsp; But there were others, pinned down and
imprisoned, whose bodies were not extricated till they had lain
for weeks and months beside their emptied cupboards, no longer on
the watch for escaping chickens.&nbsp; I was in Catania about a
year and a half after the earthquake and saw the funeral of one
whose body had recently been found; it was not the last.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
LAVA</h3>
<p>We started from Catania at three o&rsquo;clock on a dull
afternoon at the end of March to see one of the streams of lava
that Etna was sending out during the eruption of 1910.&nbsp;
Peppino Di Gregorio had arranged everything and provided four of
his friends to make company for us and to act as guides, some of
them having been before.&nbsp; He and I went in a one-horse
carriage with two of the friends and the other two came on their
bicycles.&nbsp; There was, first, another Peppino who had been in
America, where he earned his living by making cigars.&nbsp; He
had forgotten how it was done and, besides, it required special
tools, so he could not have shown me even if he had
remembered.&nbsp; Since his return home to Catania he has been
employed by the municipio.&nbsp; He begged me to call him not
Peppino but Joe, because he would be so English.&nbsp; Then there
was Ninu, also employed by the municipio, a great bullock of a
fellow bursting with health, whose legs were too short for him
and his smile a dream of romance.&nbsp; The other two were
Alessandro, about whom I got no information, and a grave
brigadier of the Guardia Municipale.</p>
<p>The road took us up-hill among villas and between walls
enclosing fields of volcanic soil, very fertile, and occasionally
a recent eruption had buried the fertility under fresh lava, hard
and black, on which nothing will grow for years.</p>
<p>Patrick Brydone went to Sicily in 1770, and wrote an account
of his journey: <i>A Tour through Sicily and Malta in a Series of
Letters to William Beckford</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>of
Somerly</i>, <i>in Suffolk</i>, <i>from Patrick Brydone</i>,
<i>F.R.S.</i>&nbsp; Near <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>Catania he
saw some lava covered with a scanty soil, incapable of producing
either corn or vines; he imagined from its barrenness that</p>
<blockquote><p>it had run from the mountain only a few ages ago;
but was surprised to be informed by Signor Recupero, the
historiographer of Etna, that this very lava is mentioned by
Diodorus Siculus to have burst from Etna in the time of the
second Punic war, when Syracuse was besieged by the Romans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that the stream ran from Etna to the sea, and cut off
the passage of a detachment of soldiers who were on their way
from Taormina to the relief of the besieged, and Diodorus took
his authority from inscriptions on Roman monuments found on the
lava itself.&nbsp; So that after about 2000 years this lava had
scarcely begun to be fertile.&nbsp; Afterwards Recupero, who was
a canonico, &ldquo;an ingenious ecclesiastic of this
place,&rdquo; told Brydone of a pit sunk near Jaci, where they
had pierced through seven parallel surfaces of lava, most of them
covered with a thick bed of rich earth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, says he [Recupero], the eruption which formed
the lowest of these lavas, if we may be allowed to reason from
analogy, must have flowed from the mountain at least 14,000 years
ago.&nbsp; Recupero tells me, he is exceedingly embarrassed by
these discoveries in writing the history of the
mountain.&mdash;That Moses hangs like a dead weight on him, and
blunts all his zeal for enquiry; for that really he has not the
conscience to make his mountain so young as that prophet makes
the world.&mdash;What do you think of these sentiments from a
Roman Catholic divine?&mdash;The bishop, who is strenuously
orthodox&mdash;for it is an excellent see&mdash;has already
warned him to be upon his guard, and not to pretend to be a
better natural historian than Moses; nor to presume to urge
anything that may in the smallest degree be deemed contradictory
to his sacred authority. . . .</p>
<p>The lava, being a very porous substance, easily catches the
dust that is carried about by the wind; which, at first I
observe, only yields a kind of moss; this rotting, and by degrees
increasing the soil, some small meagre vegetables are <!-- page
235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>next produced; which rotting in their turn, are
likewise converted into soil.&nbsp; But this process, I suppose,
is often greatly accelerated by showers of ashes from the
mountain, as I have observed in some places the richest soil, to
the depth of five or six feet and upwards; and still below that,
nothing but rocks of lava.&nbsp; It is in these spots that the
trees arrive at such an immense size.&nbsp; Their roots shoot
into the crevices of the lava, and lay such hold of it, that
there is no instance of the winds tearing them up; though there
are many of its breaking off their longest branches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We passed several villages, and on one of the churches there
was a group of three saints&mdash;S. Alfio, the padrone of the
district, and his two brothers.&nbsp; I had never heard of S.
Alfio, who they told me was a physician and lived in the third
century; one of his brothers, S. Filiberto (whom the people call
S. Liberto), was a surgeon, and his other brother, S. Cirino, was
a chemist.&nbsp; They performed miracles, endured persecution,
and were finally martyred for the faith in this way: First they
had their three tongues cut out, then they were put into a
saucepan such as the maccaroni is boiled in, only
larger&mdash;large enough to hold three saints&mdash;and full of
boiling oil: the saucepan was placed on a fire and they were
cooked in it.&nbsp; Their bodies were afterwards burnt on a
gridiron.&nbsp; This took place out of doors opposite a tavern,
and three men, who had come to the tavern to drink, saw it all
done.&nbsp; Having seen it, they went to sleep for three hundred
years; then they woke up and wanted to pay for their drinks with
the money they had in their pockets, which was money made of
leather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; asked the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is money,&rdquo; they replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no use,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; While
they had been asleep that kind of money had gone out of
circulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good money,&rdquo; they insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not money at all, it is only a piece of
leather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was money yesterday evening,&rdquo; said the
spokesman, &ldquo;when I saw Alfio, Cirino, and Liberto being
martyred.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is how the martyrdom of the three
saints is <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>represented on carts belonging to
those spiritually-minded owners who prefer the Story of S. Alfio
to the Story of the Paladins.&nbsp; It seemed to me that the
painter had been suspiciously obsessed by the number Three; it
was in the third century, there were three saints, they were each
martyred three times over, though they cannot have known much
about the boiling or the grilling, and there were three drunkards
who went to sleep for three centuries.&nbsp; But I said
nothing.&nbsp; I thought I would wait till I could see a
cart.</p>
<p>By this time we had reached Nicolosi, that is we had nearly
traversed the first of the three zones into which the Slopes of
Etna are divided.&nbsp; This lowest one is the Regione Piemontese
and Nicolosi is about 2250 feet above the sea&mdash;the place
from which tourists often start to make the ascent of the
volcano.&nbsp; Here we spent a declamatory half-hour discussing
where we should eat the provisions we had brought from Catania
and drink the wine we had bought at Mascalucia on the way.&nbsp;
The discussion ended by our being received in a peasant&rsquo;s
hut, where we spread a table for ourselves and the woman stood a
low paraffin lamp in the middle of the cloth.&nbsp; This is a bad
plan, the light dazzles one for seeing those sitting opposite and
their shadows are thrown big and black on the wall and ceiling so
that one cannot see the room, but I should say it was like
Orlando&rsquo;s bedroom in the contadino&rsquo;s cottage on
Ricuzzu&rsquo;s cart, the only room in the house, poorly
furnished and used for all purposes.&nbsp; The woman of the hut
had a baby in her arms and I said to Ninu:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether I may look at the baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you may,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;why
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I asked the woman, who smiled proudly and gave me the baby
at once.&nbsp; She called it Turi (Salvatore) and said it was
three weeks old.&nbsp; It was asleep and I nursed it till the
table was ready, which was not long, for everything was
cold.&nbsp; I handed Turi back to his mother and sat down, with
Joe on one side of me and Ninu on the other.&nbsp; <!-- page
237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>Presently Ninu inquired why I had asked whether I might
look at the baby.&nbsp; I replied that I had heard that Sicilian
peasants are so superstitious they do not like strangers to look
at their babies for fear of the evil eye; I admitted that I had
never yet met with a peasant so superstitious as to refuse to
show me her baby, but on the Slopes of Etna, during an eruption,
I had thought it wise to be careful.</p>
<p>Ninu, in the Sicilian manner, was about to say that anyone
could tell by my appearance that there was nothing to fear from
me, when Joe interrupted him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is an intelligent woman,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;I suppose you mean that she throws her
intelligence into the scale with her maternal pride, and together
they overbalance any little superstition which the proximity of
the volcano may have fostered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to put it,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do people talk so much about the evil eye?&nbsp; Do
they think it is picturesque, or do they really believe in
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe considered for a moment.&nbsp; Then he said:
&ldquo;Sometimes a peasant may decline to hand over her baby
because she thinks the stranger looks clumsy and is likely to
drop it; it would be rude to let him suspect this, so she allows
him to think she has a superstitious reason.&nbsp; And some of
her neighbours believe&mdash;at least&mdash;well, what do you
mean by believing?&nbsp; What is faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Sometimes one
thing, sometimes another.&nbsp; It is a difficult
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is that she believes that her neighbours
believe,&rdquo; said Joe, tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not the faith of S. Alfio and his brothers,
that is not the faith that wins a martyr&rsquo;s crown or that
removes mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it has its reward if it enables the believer to
feel that he is not singular, it is comfortable to feel that one
thinks as one&rsquo;s neighbours think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Thou art a happy man, Poins, to think as other
men think.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>&ldquo;I do not know anyone called Poins,&rdquo; said
Joe, &ldquo;it is not a Sicilian name; but to think as other men
think is as comfortable as a crown of martyrdom, and if it can be
won without any martyrdom worth speaking of&mdash;why, so much
the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agreed, and went on: &ldquo;And then there are the men who
never think of religion or theology, but go to Mass to please
their wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and by pleasing
their wives they reap the reward of avoiding domestic friction,
whereby they perform a miracle greater than removing
Etna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought of my poor mother who used to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, if you never go to church what hold have
you over the servants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time, I remember, I pigeon-holed her problem among
others that are still awaiting solution, and she died before I
realised how well she had translated into the language of modern
Bayswater the &ldquo;Paris vaut bien une Messe&rdquo; of Henri
Quatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to see faith,&rdquo; said Peppino Di
Gregorio, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you stay and go to the festa of
S. Alfio at Trecastagne?&nbsp; You might even see a miracle
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that when anyone is in hospital with a broken leg
after an accident or suffering from any illness, especially
hernia, he cries in his despair, making use of this form:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, S. Alfio! cure me of this illness, restore my broken
leg or cure my hernia&rdquo; (or as may be) &ldquo;and for the
love of my wife, of my children, of my mother&rdquo; (or as may
be) &ldquo;I will run naked to Trecastagne and light a candle
before your shrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After making this vow, the patient recovers and then he must
not fail.&nbsp; With any other saint there may be failure, but
not with S. Alfio, for he is more powerful than the Madonna or
than the Padre Eterno or than the Redeemer.&nbsp; He is the
Padrone and performs miracles.</p>
<p><!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>&ldquo;But how long should I have to stay?&nbsp; When
is this festa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would not be till the 10th of May, nearly six weeks ahead,
and that made it a matter requiring consideration and, as it was
now half-past seven and dark, we had to leave off talking and
start for the lava.</p>
<p>Those of our friends who had made the excursion before were
delightful as company, but we hardly wanted them as guides,
because the way was shown by hundreds of people who were
returning, many of them carrying torches, and we only had to walk
in the opposite direction.&nbsp; We also carried a
light&mdash;the acetylene lamp off Ninu&rsquo;s bicycle, and it
functioned as inefficiently as the bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern which
Mr. Pickwick took with him on his nocturnal expedition at
Clifton.&nbsp; The road was broad enough, but strewn with big
lumps of lava lying half-hidden in lava sand.&nbsp; I stumbled
frequently, but I never fell, because one of my friends was
always at my elbow and caught me; either it was the brave
brigadier or Alessandro or Joe or the other Peppino or that great
hulking Ninu with his operatic smile lighted up by his fitful
lamp.&nbsp; They took care of me all the way until, after about
an hour, we turned into a vineyard, called the Contrada Fra
Diavolo, and our progress was stopped by a sloping embankment
over twenty feet high.</p>
<p>This was the broad nose of the stream of lava.&nbsp; It was
coming towards us at about eighty feet an hour, but its velocity
varies according to the slope of the ground and the cooling and
consistency of the material.&nbsp; The course of the stream
described a curve from the mouth to the place where we stood, and
the width of it gradually increased until opposite us it was
about a quarter of a mile broad.&nbsp; There was plenty of smoke,
fiery with the light reflected from the glowing stream, and
especially thick in the direction of the mouth.&nbsp; The lava
was sluggish, viscous, heavy stuff, full of bubbles, pushing
itself along and kneading itself like dough.&nbsp; Red-hot
boulders and shapeless lumps <!-- page 240--><a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>of all
manner of sizes were continually losing their balance and rolling
lazily down the slope towards us; as they rolled they disengaged
little avalanches of rapid sparks, and when they reached the
ground they sometimes fell against a vine stump and set it in a
blaze for a moment.&nbsp; They said that this is Etna&rsquo;s
cunning way of taking a glass of wine; he opens a mouth and
consumes a vineyard.&nbsp; All the time there was a roaring noise
like coals being thrown on the fire, only much louder, and the
great sloping wall glowed in the places where open crevasses left
by the crumbling blocks had stirred it.&nbsp; It was too hot for
us to go very near, nevertheless, my companions were not content
to leave without bringing some pieces of lava away.&nbsp; They
went towards it with canes which the vines will not want this
year, unless the stream stops before it has broadened over the
contrada, and with much difficulty and scorching, manipulated
bits of red-hot lava until they had got them far enough away to
deal with them, and then, balancing them on the end of two canes,
they brought them to where I was resting near a doomed hut.</p>
<p>After spending an hour, fascinated by the spectacle, we
returned by the sandy, rocky road to Nicolosi.&nbsp; While the
carriage was being got ready, I said to Joe:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, if I lived on the Slopes of Etna, close to
such a sight as we have been contemplating, I think I should
believe in the evil eye and S. Alfio and everything
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He assured me that it would not have any such effect unless,
perhaps, during the periods of actual eruption&mdash;as soon as
the eruption was over I should forget all about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we not all live on the slopes of volcanoes?&rdquo;
asked Joe.&nbsp; &ldquo;An eruption cannot do more than ruin you
or kill you.&nbsp; And without coming to live on the Slopes of
Etna you might be ruined or die at any moment.&nbsp; How do you
know that you have not now in you the seeds of some fatal disease
that will declare itself before you return home?&nbsp; Or you may
be run over in the street or killed in a railway <!-- page
241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>accident any day.&nbsp; And as for ruin, next time you
look into an English newspaper you may see that all your
investments have left off paying dividends and have gone down to
an unsaleable price.&nbsp; Perhaps at this moment, in some
Foreign Office, a despatch is being drafted that will lead to a
declaration of war and the ruin of England and you with it.&nbsp;
And yet you never worry about all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps I had better begin to believe in S. Alfio
at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially if you are threatened with
hernia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said something about hernia before.&nbsp; What has
hernia to do with it?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S. Alfio&rsquo;s first miracle was to cure one of his
brothers of that complaint, which he had contracted while
carrying a beam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But was not S. Alfio a medical man?&nbsp; Why do you
call it a miracle when a medical man cures his patient?&nbsp;
Have you been reading the plays of Moli&egrave;re?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Moli&egrave;re?&rdquo; asked one of them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did he write his plays in the Catanian dialect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It does not do to make these allusions when talking with
Sicilians who are employed in the municipio.&nbsp; One might as
well quote <i>Candide</i> to some young schoolmaster who thinks
the only thing worth knowing is the date of the Battle of
Salamis.&nbsp; So I returned to S. Alfio and asked whether he
always answers all prayers; they said the people believe he does
or they hope he will.&nbsp; One of them, thinking I was inclined
to scoff, rebuked me, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had been to Trecastagne and seen what I have
seen, you would believe.&nbsp; I saw in the church there a dumb
man.&nbsp; He tried to shout &lsquo;Viva S. Alfio,&rsquo; but
could only make inarticulate noises.&nbsp; The people encouraged
him, and he went on trying till at last he said the words
distinctly.&nbsp; I heard him say them.&nbsp; You are making a
mistake in not going to Trecastagne.&nbsp; You might also behold
a miracle and then you would believe as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought of G&eacute;ronte when his daughter recovers her
<!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>speech in <i>Le M&eacute;decin Malgr&eacute; Lui</i>
and wanted to ask how long this dumb man retained his miraculous
power and whether his relations and friends were pleased about it
and whether, after the novelty had worn off, they continued
shouting &ldquo;Viva S. Alfio.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I said nothing; I
was afraid of confirming them in the notion that I was scoffing,
whereas I was very much impressed; the influence of the stream of
lava was still upon me and all that Joe had said about living on
the slopes of volcanoes.&nbsp; And I was wondering whether I
could manage to be back in Catania for the 10th of May and see
the people running naked to Trecastagne.&nbsp; I was not anxious
to go there myself, not because I should have had to run naked
all the thirteen kilometres, they would have let me wear my
clothes and drive in a painted cart, but because there is no
albergo there and it would have meant being up all night.&nbsp;
If S. Alfio had earned his reputation by restoring those who
spend sleepless nights in the street, I might have given him a
chance of exercising his power on me.</p>
<p>There is generally some way of doing anything one really wants
to do, and by the time we were separating in Catania, at one
o&rsquo;clock in the morning I was promising to try to return in
time for the Festa di S. Alfio.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIX<br />
S. ALFIO</h3>
<p>I was back in Catania before the 9th of May and began talking
about S. Alfio in the Teatro Machiavelli.&nbsp; One of the actors
whose name is Volpes, the one who did the listening father in the
play about Rosina and the good young man, is employed by day in
the cathedral, his department being the brass-work; he is
therefore something of a hagiologist.&nbsp; He was going on
business to Lentini, which is situated to the south of Catania on
the way to <!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>Siracusa, it is the place where the
three saintly brothers were martyred, and there he bought for me
a book&mdash;<i>Storia dei Martiri e della Chiesa di Lentini</i>,
by Sebastiano Pisano Baudo (Lentini: Giuseppe Saluta,
1898)&mdash;from which I have collected particulars for this
story of the Life of S. Alfio.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the first half of the third century after
Christ, at Prefetta in Gascony, the wealthy and noble Prince
Vitale lived a life of singular piety, united in matrimony to
Benedetta di Locusta.&nbsp; Heaven had blessed them with three
sons, Alfio born in 230, Filiberto born one year and eight months
later and Cirino born one year and four months later again.&nbsp;
Prefetta was not only in Gascony, it was also in Aquitaine, and,
notwithstanding this, it was in Spain and also in the Abruzzi,
which is a region of Italy between Naples and Taranto, if I
understand correctly.&nbsp; Owing to its unsettled habits
geographers do not mark it on the maps, but they and the
historians are agreed that it certainly existed, and perhaps it
exists still, if only in a Castellinarian sense.&nbsp; The
interesting point is that it was the birthplace of S. Alfio.</p>
<p>The noble and saintly Benedetta, having been brought up in the
school of sacrifice, ardently desired to die for the faith.&nbsp;
Her husband placed no obstacle in her way.&nbsp; She obtained an
interview with the prefect, abused his gods and awaited the
sentence which took the form of decapitation.</p>
<p>Prince Vitale after the death of his wife was free to
consecrate himself to the education of his three sons.&nbsp; I
expected to find that he had them taught medicine, surgery and
chemistry, but there is not a word about any of these
subjects.&nbsp; Evodio di Bisanzio, flying from country to
country to avoid the persecution of Massimino, happened upon
Prefetta; he was welcomed by Vitale, who appointed him tutor of
his boys.&nbsp; Evodio was learned in the sacred sciences, the
Greek fables and how to live rightly.&nbsp; These were the
subjects which he taught to his pupils.&nbsp; Alfio copied out
the Books of the Prophets, Filiberto the Gospels <!-- page
244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>and Cirino the Letters of S. Paul and the Acts of the
Apostles.&nbsp; Thus they developed a manly spirit, angelic
habits and an intelligence, a piety, a devotion which are the
rare gifts of a few privileged souls.</p>
<p>Onesimo was their next tutor, a man of deep learning and a
fervent missionary who came to Prefetta with a following of
thirteen or fourteen disciples and boarded and lodged with Prince
Vitale.&nbsp; He was more the kind of tutor Vitale wanted for his
boys.&nbsp; Onesimo had no sympathy with flying from persecution;
he took the view that it was not enough to copy the sacred Books,
his pupils must know how to sacrifice their frail bodies for the
glory of the Cross.&nbsp; He instructed them in the practical
work of martyrdom.</p>
<p>In the year 249, Decio ascended the imperial throne and issued
an edict against the Christians.&nbsp; Vitale and Onesimo heard
of it and welcomed this opportunity for the three brothers who
swore on the ashes of their mother that they would profit by
it.&nbsp; They did not have to wait long.&nbsp; Nigellione, the
imperial minister, came to execute the decree.&nbsp; Onesimo and
his pupils, in spite of tortures, professed their unalterable
faith in the Cross and were sent to Rome together with fourteen
other Christians.&nbsp; Vitale, being thus freed from all family
responsibilities, exiled himself with his friends and awaited his
end in a sacred retreat so retired that our author does not
specify it.</p>
<p>In Rome, Onesimo and his band of Christians suffered
tortures.&nbsp; While in prison S. Peter and S. Paul appeared to
them, healed their wounds, exhorted them to persevere and
promised ultimate victory.&nbsp; On the seventh day they were
taken before Valeriano, the imperial minister.&nbsp; Failing, as
Nigellione had failed, to shake their faith, he sent them with a
letter to Diomede, Prince of Pozzuoli, telling him that if he
could not win the captives over from their new faith he was to
put to death Onesimo and the fourteen disciples by means of
fierce tortures, and to send Alfio, Filiberto and Cirino into
Sicily to be dealt with according <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>to
instructions contained in another letter addressed to the crafty
Tertullo, Governor of Sicily, at Lentini.</p>
<p>Diomede carried out his instructions.&nbsp; The Christians all
refused to sacrifice to the false gods.&nbsp; Onesimo died in
consequence of an unusually large stone being placed upon his
chest, the fourteen disciples were decapitated and Alfio,
Filiberto and Cirino were handed over to fifty soldiers under
Captain Silvano, a man of a proud and cruel nature, and taken in
a ship to Messina.</p>
<p>The voyage occupied three days; they reposed in Messina for
two hours and then, chained together and barefooted, proceeded to
Taormina, where Tertullo happened to be hunting for Christians,
and to him Captain Silvano delivered the letter from
Valeriano.&nbsp; Tertullo&rsquo;s instructions were to make the
most of his attractive appearance and his agreeable manners and
by means of cajolery to persuade the three holy brethren to
sacrifice to the gods of Rome; in case of failure he was to cause
them to suffer many and various tortures and then to deprive them
of their lives.</p>
<p>Tertullo concocted a scheme worthy of the devil.&nbsp; No
sooner were the youths brought into his presence than he assumed
the appearance of an affectionate father, embraced them and
inquired sympathetically about their parents and their
home.&nbsp; On their telling him they were Christians he
endeavoured, with apparent kindness, to turn them from a faith
which had brought them nothing but suffering.&nbsp; He promised
that if they would sacrifice to the gods of Rome they should
enjoy the pleasures of a court life.&nbsp; But there was none of
the <i>Paris vaut bien une Messe</i> about the sons of the
saintly Benedetta.&nbsp; They spurned his promises and continued
to declare themselves firm believers in the true Cross.&nbsp;
Tertullo, defeated and angry, thereupon showed himself in his
true colours; he dropped the affectionate parent and ordered the
brothers to be tortured.&nbsp; He then sent them with Captain
Mercurio and a squadron of forty soldiers to Lentini to await his
return to that city.</p>
<p><!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>At Mascali they were fatigued, especially Filiberto,
who almost succumbed.&nbsp; They prayed to the Omnipotent and,
before they had risen from their knees, the azure heavens became
obscured, the wind blew, the thunder roared, the lightning
flashed and there was a great rain.&nbsp; The forty soldiers fell
upon their faces, frightened nearly to death, and in the tempest
onward came a venerable man, believed by all who saw him to be S.
Andrea.&nbsp; This personage restored the youths; whereupon the
rain ceased, the clouds dispersed, the heavens smiled again and
the forty soldiers rose from the ground declaring that the God
worshipped by their prisoners must be more powerful than they had
supposed.</p>
<p>In those days the usual road from Taormina to Lentini passed
along by the seashore, but Captain Mercurio took the three
brothers by an inland route passing through Trecastagni, perhaps
because the road by the shore was encumbered with lava from an
eruption of Etna which occurred in the year 251 or 252.&nbsp;
When I came to this I thought of Diodorus Siculus and the second
Punic war, but I repressed the suspicion that the compiler of the
story was consciously borrowing a bit of local colour in order to
get S. Alfio to Trecastagni in a picturesque manner.</p>
<p>It was the end of August or the beginning of September in the
year 252 when the three saints reached Trecastagni.&nbsp; Here
they sat on a rock which diversified the uniformity of the
landscape, partook of food and reposed.&nbsp; Exhilarated by a
laughing sky of rarest beauty, the holy brethren unloosed their
tongues and sang hymns of joy and praise to the Lord for that he
had given them the strength and spirit to face their anticipated
martyrdom.&nbsp; On the spot where they reposed now stands the
parish church of Trecastagni.</p>
<p>The three saints proceeded to Catania, where they passed an
uncomfortable night singing hymns in an obscure prison, and at
daybreak were taken on towards Lentini.&nbsp; The river Simeto
was in flood owing to the recent abundant rain, which is perhaps
a reference to the storm at <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>Mascali; as
soon as the saints put their feet in the stream it shrank and
they passed over.&nbsp; Eight of the soldiers attempted to follow
in their footsteps, but a sudden rush of water engulfed them
together with their horses; this danger caused the remaining
thirty-two soldiers to stay where they were, and they patiently
waited four days till they were fetched by their comrades who, I
suppose, had got over the river and employed the time in drying
their uniforms and recovering from their wetting, but at first I
feared they had been drowned.</p>
<p>Eight hundred paces to the north of Lentini the glorious
brothers met a young man of the Jewish religion who had eaten
nothing for a month.&nbsp; Captain Mercurio, having seen and been
much touched by the portents performed by his prisoners during
the journey, begged them to restore the youth.&nbsp; Immediately,
with no assistance from anyone, the saints broke the ropes that
bound them, prayed to heaven, approached the sufferer, infused
new life into his exhausted frame and restored him to perfect
health.&nbsp; The youth and his parents confessed their faith in
the Nazarene, Captain Mercurio also declared himself converted
and twenty of the soldiers, dismounting from their horses, threw
their arms on the ground and prayed to be bound with chains since
they now abhorred the false pagan gods and intended for the
future to worship only the God of the three brothers.</p>
<p>They entered Lentini on Wednesday the 3rd of September, 252,
their hands bound behind them, their heads uncovered and their
feet bare, presenting to the emotional crowd an appearance of
great nobility.&nbsp; They were put in prison with the twenty
converted soldiers, tortured and starved; but a venerable man
girdled with grace and celestial light miraculously brought food
to them, embraced them and blessed them, their wounds were
healed, their strength was restored, their courage was
reinforced.&nbsp; Their tortures were increased after this, and
so it went on till the 10th of May, 253, when S. Alfio was killed
by having his <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>tongue pulled out, S. Filiberto was
burnt on a gridiron and S. Cirino was boiled in pitch and
bitumen.</p>
<p>Eight years later, in June, 261, Vitale in his retirement was
cheered by a visit from Neofito and Aquila, who brought to him,
as tokens of the martyrdom of his three sons, the mantle of
Alfio, the girdle of Filiberto and the veil of Cirino, saturated
with blood.</p>
<p>The geographers write Trecastagne on the maps as though the
village took its name from Three Chestnut Trees, but the learned
say it should be Trecastagni&mdash;Tre Casti Agni, that is Three
Chaste Lambs, after the three saints who rested on the site of
the parish church.&nbsp; Their memory is perpetuated also at
Mascali, Catania and Lentini.&nbsp; And they are adored at
Aci-reale, Pedara and at other places on the eastern slopes,
whence the faithful come to their shrine at Trecastagne on the
10th of May.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XX<br />
THE NAKED RUNNERS</h3>
<p>One may see in the foregoing story of S. Alfio the foundation
of some of the incidents painted on the carts, and perhaps the
saints&rsquo; travelling bareheaded and barefooted is the origin
of the people running so to Trecastagne, but I can find nothing
in the book to support the belief that S. Alfio was a medical man
or that he ever cured anyone of hernia.&nbsp; Nevertheless that
he was a medical man, especially successful in treating hernia,
is believed by everyone in and round Catania.&nbsp; Fortified by
my book I ventured to doubt it and asked my friends in what
university he took his diploma.&nbsp; They replied that I was
confusing cause and effect; for in the beginning it was not the
universities that made the doctors, it was the doctors that made
the universities.</p>
<p>I then pointed out that he could not even cure himself <!--
page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>from the wounds made by the tortures; SS. Peter and
Paul had to come to the Roman prison, S. Andrea had to be called
in at Mascali and the old man girdled with grace and celestial
light at Lentini.&nbsp; But they disposed of this by reminding me
that medical men are notoriously powerless to cure
themselves.</p>
<p>Then I objected that a saint who was born in 230 and who died
in 253 was too young to have got together anything of a
practice.&nbsp; They replied that the carts show him exercising
his profession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are these carts?&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If they are in Catania, let them be called and give their
evidence in the usual manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we looked at all the carts we met that were not going too
fast.&nbsp; On one of them Garibaldi was landing at Marsala and
overcoming the Bourbons at Calatafimi; on another Cristoforo
Colombo was receiving a bag of gold from Ferdinand and Isabella,
who wanted to put an end to all this wearing delay about the
discovery of America; on another Don Jos&eacute; was being made a
fool of by Carmen in the wine-shop of Lillas Pastia; we saw the
enthusiasm of the Crusaders on catching sight of Jerusalem;
Otello was smothering Desdemona; we saw the Rape of the Sabines
and somebody before the Soldan.&nbsp; But none of these pictures
threw any light on S. Alfio.</p>
<p>Peppino Di Gregorio said we must have patience.&nbsp; So we
patiently turned down another street and saw King Ruggero
dismissing the ambassadors: &ldquo;Return at once to your Lord
and tell him that we Sicilians are not&mdash;&rdquo; something
for which the artist had left so little room that it was
illegible, but the noble attitude of King Ruggero conveyed the
meaning: we saw Mazeppa bound to a white horse rushing through a
rocky wood and frightening the lions and tigers; Etna was in
eruption; banners were being blessed by the Pope; Musolino was
tripping over that cursed wire and being taken by the
carabinieri; Paolo and Francesca were abandoning the pursuit of
<!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>literature in favour of an eternity of
torment&mdash;anything rather than go on reading in that
book.&nbsp; Still there was nothing about S. Alfio.</p>
<p>They then proposed a visit to the workshop of a man who earns
his living by painting carts.&nbsp; We found him at work on the
birth of Rinaldo who came into the world with his right hand
closed.&nbsp; The doctors and nurses were standing round,
wondering; they all tried but they could do nothing.&nbsp; After
eight days the baby, yielding to the incessant caresses of his
adorata mamma, opened his fist and lo! it contained a scrap of
paper with his name&mdash;Rinaldo&mdash;written upon it.</p>
<p>We begged the artist to show us a cart with the Life of S.
Alfio, or the designs for such a life.&nbsp; And he could
not.&nbsp; He said such carts were rare and he had no designs;
when asked to paint the story of S. Alfio he does it out of his
head, putting in anything that his patrons particularly
order.&nbsp; We asked how old he makes the saints and he replied
that his instructions usually are to make them about
sixteen.&nbsp; So that the carts, if we could find them, would
not be evidence of anything but the well-known habit of artists
to flatter their sitters.&nbsp; Still I should have liked to see
pictures of the young doctor, the young surgeon and the young
chemist curing patients of hernia and being martyred for the
faith.</p>
<p>On the 9th of May in the evening we all went to the Teatro
Machiavelli and, coming out a little before midnight, walked up
the Via Stesicoro Etnea to the Piazza Cavour.&nbsp; The pavements
were lined with people who had come to see the sight and the
roadway was left for those who were going to Trecastagne.&nbsp;
There were innumerable painted carts, some of them nearly as fine
as Ricuzzu&rsquo;s birthday present; the horses and mules were so
splendidly harnessed and so proud of themselves that Peppino Di
Gregorio called them &ldquo;cavalli mafiosi&rdquo;; they were
driving fast out of the city with coloured lights and
fireworks.&nbsp; Every now and then came a naked man running in
the road and carrying <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>a large wax candle.&nbsp; They speak
of them as I Nudi, but they were not really naked; they wore
white cotton drawers down to their knees, a broad red waist-band
and a broad red scarf and some of them wore a flannel
jersey.&nbsp; They were all bare-headed and bare-footed, or
rather without boots, for they wore socks; this is enough to
satisfy S. Alfio, who, being a doctor, does not insist on their
taking needless risk.&nbsp; Nevertheless the socks must get torn
to pieces before they are out of the town, and their feet must be
bleeding long before they reach Trecastagne.&nbsp; Some of the
so-called nudi, both men and women, were fully dressed except
that they were without hats or boots.&nbsp; They all ran,
occasionally they may rest by walking, but they may not dance and
they may not stop and they may not greet their friends in the
crowd except by shouting &ldquo;Con vera fede, Viva S.
Alfio!&rdquo;&nbsp; Each of them carries his candle in his hand
and it may cost five or ten francs, some cost as much as twenty
francs.&nbsp; For days before the festa they go about Catania
with trays collecting soldi from all they meet.&nbsp; But if one
of them meets the doctor who attended him in the hospital, he is
careful not to make the mistake of asking the doctor for a
subscription.&nbsp; So they ran and shouted, and I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the carts that ought to have the story of S.
Alfio.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t we stop one and look at
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They recommended me not to try, it would block the stream of
traffic and the people would not like it.&nbsp; So we sat in the
piazza till about two in the morning and watched them
passing.</p>
<p>That was not all we were to see.&nbsp; In the afternoon of the
10th of May everyone who was left in Catania went out towards
Trecastagne to see the return of the people, who are said to be
drunk after their religious devotions.&nbsp; In order to do this
in comfort Peppino Di Gregorio had arranged that we should go to
colazione with Giovanni Bianca, a friend of his who has a country
house on the Slopes of Etna near the route, and afterwards we
would go where we could <!-- page 252--><a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>see the
return of the devout.&nbsp; First, he said, we must go to the
station and fetch Joe, because he was to come too.</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;With pleasure, but why go to the station?&nbsp;
I thought Joe was employed in the municipio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall find him keeping order among the coachmen in
the station-yard,&rdquo; replied Peppino.</p>
<p>And there he was in the uniform of a guardia municipale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Joe!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;I thought you were
writing at a desk all day in the Mansion House.&nbsp; I did not
know you were a policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied that he was a guardia municipale, which is not
exactly the same thing, and was going on to explain the
difference between the carabinieri, the pubblica sicurezza, the
guardia municipale, the guardia campestre and all the rest of it,
when I interrupted him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never remember what you are telling me; I shall
always think of you as a policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be Joe
the Policeman, and Ninu is a policeman too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can quite believe it,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When we went to the lava you both treated me just as our
policemen in London treat the old ladies and gentlemen who are
afraid of the traffic; you helped me along and never let me fall
down, and looked after me as though I had been given specially
into your charge.&nbsp; London policemen are just like
that&mdash;very kind and helpful.&nbsp; I know one of them in
private life and he is a capital fellow.&nbsp; I made his
acquaintance over my bicycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; inquired Joe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you
get run over and did he pick you up?&nbsp; What did I tell you
about living on the slopes of volcanoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not exactly that,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;it
was because I wanted to avoid being run over that I gave my
bicycle to a man to sell it for me when the motor-cars began to
get on my nerves, and this policeman bought it.&nbsp; He did not
give much for it, but if the value of his friendship is taken
into the account I think I made rather a good bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>&ldquo;Tell me about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing to tell.&nbsp; He comes to
see me sometimes, when he is free.&nbsp; We have tastes in
common; for instance, we do not like knock-about brothers at a
music-hall&mdash;they bore us.&nbsp; And then books; our tastes
in literature, however, are less alike; but he is quite a
reader.&nbsp; Once he had in his pocket The <i>Beauties of
Nature</i>, by Sir John Lubbock&mdash;that was to improve his
mind&mdash;and <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i>, which he was
reading for pure enjoyment.&nbsp; I told him that I also had
written a book and he wanted to read it, so I lent it to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he appreciated it?&rdquo; inquired Joe
sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was extremely polite about it.&nbsp; Next time I saw
him he said: &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been reading your
book&rsquo;; (he spoke with great deliberation) &lsquo;I can get
on with it.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t drag upon me.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s time wasted.&nbsp; But, you know,
if I ever do anything of that sort, I think it will be more in
the style of Charlie Dickens.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not call that very polite of him, was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure.&nbsp; We must distinguish.&nbsp; He
was not thinking of the Dickens of <i>Pickwick</i> with all his
beaux moments, he was thinking of that other Dickens of the
<i>Christmas Books</i> with all his mauvais quarts
d&rsquo;heure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you two authors named Dickens in
England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I saw that to my audience Dickens was as much a sealed
book as Moli&egrave;re and that my literary policeman must be
reserved until I can write <i>Diversions in London</i>.&nbsp; So
I turned the conversation by telling Joe that Dickens is not an
uncommon name in England and is a form of Riccardo, as Jones is a
form of Giovanni.</p>
<p>While talking we were on our way to Joe&rsquo;s house, where
he changed from his uniform to his private clothes, and then we
took the tram to Cibali.&nbsp; Here we bought provisions and
carried them with us to the country house, which was not yet
properly open for the summer.&nbsp; We had picked <!-- page
254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>up
our host, Giovanni Bianca, on the way, and he took us round and
showed us the garden, which was full of flowers and fruit trees
and vines; he showed us also the lava of 1669 which destroyed
part of Catania.&nbsp; He gave me a piece of primeval lava from
the bottom of the well which his father had dug, about 150 feet
down.&nbsp; I inquired how old that lava would be.&nbsp; He was
not sure, but it would be older than the Romans, older than the
Greeks, older than the Sikels or the Sikans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say ten thousand years old,&rdquo; said Giovanni, and
he said it without being in the least embarrassed, but then he is
not a canonico and has not Moses hanging as a dead weight on
him.&nbsp; He went on to say that he did not really know.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The memory of man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;works very
imperfectly, and to understand these things one ought to study
the science of geology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the afternoon we went across country to a spot on the
route, past which the people had already begun to come.&nbsp; I
asked, what they had been doing at Trecastagne all night.&nbsp;
They told me that the journey from Catania takes about three
hours, more or less according to the ability of the runner, so
that they begin to arrive somewhere about 3 a.m. and keep on
arriving all the morning; and others come from other villages on
the eastern slopes.&nbsp; Then they make a row till the church is
opened and the nudi go in and light their candles before S.
Alfio.&nbsp; Some of them go on their knees and lick the stone
floor of the church all the way from the entrance to the altar,
but this is being discouraged because it covers the floor with
blood and is considered not to be hygienic.&nbsp; Perhaps it
might also be well to prohibit the running with bare feet, for
that must also make the floor in an unhygienic condition, to say
nothing of the roads that lead to the village.&nbsp; Some take
stones and beat their breasts, and they all shout continually
&ldquo;Con buona fede, Viva S. Alfio!&rdquo;&nbsp; After Mass
they dress and eat and drink.&nbsp; Some of them have carried
their food on their backs, others have friends who have brought
it in their carts, and the <!-- page 255--><a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>food
includes eels, which come from the Lake of Lentini; thus they
enjoy the luxury of eating fish on the Slopes of Etna and
moreover fish from the place of S. Alfio&rsquo;s martyrdom.&nbsp;
At midday the car bearing the three saints is brought out into
the street, but this, it seems, does not interest the nudi; they
have run naked to the shrine, they have lighted their candles,
they have performed their vow and are now free to enjoy
themselves.&nbsp; Of course, those who suffer from hernia do not
attempt to run until after they believe themselves to be cured of
that complaint; but rheumatic patients are often much better
after running to Trecastagne, the exertion has upon them an
effect like that of a Turkish bath, but it knocks them up in
other ways.</p>
<p>By the afternoon, when it is time to return, what with the
running, the walking, the driving, the fasting, the shouting, the
religious exaltation, the want of sleep, the eating and drinking,
the fireworks and the jollity of the festa, many of them are
drunk.&nbsp; Joe says the festa is a continuation of some Bacchic
festival, and this is more than likely, just as it is more than
likely that the Bacchic festival was a continuation of some
earlier one.&nbsp; He wants S. Alfio to be a transformation of
Bacchus, just as Bacchus was a transformation of Dionysus and
Dionysus of some earlier divinity, and so on back to him who
first discovered wine, ages and ages before the vates sacer who
immortalised Noah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much do the people believe?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied Joe; &ldquo;who knows?&nbsp; And
what is faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;sometimes one thing and sometimes another.&nbsp; It is a
difficult question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I remembered that he had asked me the same question, and
I had made the same reply at Nicolosi six weeks before, and I
also remembered something that had happened in between.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The other day,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I had to wait in
the station at Messina, and I asked the porter who was helping me
with my baggage whether he <!-- page 256--><a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>had seen
the comet.&nbsp; He replied, &lsquo;No, I have not seen the
comet, and I shall not even look for it; I do not believe in the
comet.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know what he meant by that?&nbsp; He had
heard that it was going to destroy the world, so he did not want
to believe in it; he did not want it to exist; he was not going
to encourage such a dangerous phenomenon by having anything to do
with it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you alone and I expect you
to leave me alone.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I suppose he thought that if he removed his custom
the comet would fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; But it is not quite that with S.
Alfio; they want him to exist; they are afraid that if they
don&rsquo;t believe in him, he will leave off performing miracles
and will no longer cure them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that they are
dominated by the prepotenza of S. Alfio very much as the
sulphur-miners are dominated by the prepotenza of their
capo-mafioso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this distinction,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that
the capo-mafioso has the power, and sometimes the will, to hurt
them; it would require a struggle to destroy his prepotenza and
there is the risk of failure.&nbsp; With S. Alfio, if they cared
to be master in their own house, they have only got to leave off
believing in him, there need be no struggle and there could be no
risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as though they could believe or leave off
believing at will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they can, in the loose sense in which they use the
word.&nbsp; They only go on believing because their vanity is
involved&mdash;it flatters them to attribute the gift of miracles
to a creature of their own imagination and, by being satisfied
with very little and very poor evidence, they make things easy
for S. Alfio.&nbsp; But they could not tell you this themselves,
they are half asleep about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Of course they are half asleep about it, and
all S. Alfio&rsquo;s interests are bound up in their remaining
so.&nbsp; They are not only asleep, they are dreaming, as the Red
<!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>King dreamt of Alice.&nbsp; If they were to wake up S.
Alfio would go out&mdash;bang!&mdash;just like a
candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice and the Red King were as unknown to Joe as Poins or
Moli&egrave;re or Dickens.&nbsp; I did my best to explain the
allusion, but I doubt whether I succeeded, for when I had
finished he only said that Tweedledum and Tweedledee had better
not go about saying things like that, or their bishop would be
warning them to be on their guard as he warned the Canonico
Recupero.&nbsp; I must try whether he will understand better if I
send him a copy of <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> for his next
onomastico.&nbsp; He told me something which makes me suspect
that the people must have a dim feeling of how things really
are.&nbsp; It seems that sometimes, though rarely, it pleases
them to pretend to believe that their padrone has displeased
them.&nbsp; Then they half wake up and depose him; but nothing
comes of it, they only choose a new one or, after a short time,
reinstate the old one.</p>
<p>We went to a house on the route and sat on a balcony in the
sunset and the drunken people pelted down-hill, smothered in the
golden glory of the dust they raised, banging their tambourines,
blowing their whistles, and singing that now the festa was over
they must go home and work to pay the debts it had run them
into.&nbsp; It was no more use to think of stopping them to see
the pictures now than when they were going out; so I pigeon-holed
what the carts say about S. Alfio with my poor mother&rsquo;s
problem about what influence people who never go to church have
over their servants.&nbsp; The cavalli mafiosi and the carts were
stuck about with coloured feathers and festooned with bunches of
garlic, with flowers, with lumps of lard, with little flags and
ribbons, with garlands of caruba beans and with vetch.&nbsp; The
flags, the ribbons, the flowers and the feathers were, I suppose,
for gaiety and festa&mdash;pour faire la frime&mdash;but garlic
has some magically beneficent properties; not only does it avert
the evil eye, it is also a symbol of robust health, so that
instead of replying to &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; by saying
&ldquo;As right as <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>rain,&rdquo; they reply, &ldquo;As
right as garlic.&rdquo;&nbsp; They believe that to put three
crosses of garlic under the bed of a woman in child-birth will
ensure a happy issue.&nbsp; There is something fortunate or
healthy also about vetch and, no doubt, some special significance
about lard and the beans of the carob.&nbsp; These beliefs are
based lower than Giovanni Bianca&rsquo;s primeval lava, and I
know no more about their origin than he does, but I suppose they
are older than the Romans, older than the Greeks, older than the
Sikels and the Sikans&mdash;probably much more than ten thousand
or fourteen thousand years old.&nbsp; They spring from a soil
which has become fertile by catching the dust of ages, tossed to
and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine, wherein
generations of beliefs have grown up, flourished and
decayed.&nbsp; There is no more fertilising manure for a
struggling young faith than the rotting remains of a dead
superstition.&nbsp; And the roots pierce down beneath the soil
and shoot into the crevices of an intolerance more unyielding
than buried lava.&nbsp; To understand these things, one ought to
become a pupil of Professore Pitr&egrave;, and make a study of
the science of demopsicologia, and even then one would only get
glimpses of the more recent deposits of civilisation that lie
crushed one under the other like the parallel surfaces of rich
earth in the pit sunk near Jaci.</p>
<p>Whatever the significance of the things they carried or the
origin of their belief in them, the people in the carts kept
flinging them to the boys in the road, who caught them and picked
them up and carried them off to make their festa with them later
on.&nbsp; They were all very lively, but no one seemed to me very
drunk, not more drunk than the nudi were naked; there were
drunken people among them, but not enough to make me feel sure
that S. Alfio ought to be identified with Bacchus.&nbsp; One can
see more drunkenness on Hampstead Heath on a Bank Holiday, but
one does not hastily identify Saint Lubbock with Dionysus.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI<br />
HOLY WEEK</h3>
<h4>PALM SUNDAY</h4>
<p>Being in Catania for Holy Week I went to the cathedral on Palm
Sunday.&nbsp; The archbishop in his yellow mitre, red inside
because he is also a cardinal, accompanied by nine canons in
white mitres and many priests and others, passed out of the
church by a side exit and proceeded to the western entrance,
which was closed against him.&nbsp; I heard him knock and
listened to the chanted dialogue which he carried on with those
inside.&nbsp; I saw the great doors thrown open and watched the
procession enter and pass up the nave among crowds of people who
waved palm-branches.</p>
<p>After this I called at the Teatro Sicilia, the marionette
theatre of Gregorio Grasso, and discovered that he was devoting
all the week to the Story of the Passion and would begin that
evening with the event which I had seen commemorated by the
procession in the cathedral.&nbsp; Here was an opportunity to see
something which I had often wished to see and about which I had
talked with Achille Greco and his sons in their theatre at
Palermo, where they also do the Passion in Holy Week, using a
play in verse written by Filippo Orioles of which they have a MS.
copy; but they have not performed it recently because it takes
too much preparation.&nbsp; Orioles wrote his play for living
actors, and it is laid out to get all the events into one
performance instead of being a series of seven performances
extending over a whole week as in Catania.</p>
<p>Gregorio Grasso took me behind, where one of his assistants,
Carmelo, showed me the preparations and told <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>me about
the performance.&nbsp; The first scene was to be the meeting of
the Sanhedrin and the beginning of the conspiracy of Annas and
Caiaphas to destroy the Nazarene; this makes a firm foundation on
which the rest of the drama is built.&nbsp; The second scene
would be the departure of Christ with Mary; after that would come
the Entry with Palms into Jerusalem, and the evening was to
conclude with a cinematograph show.</p>
<p>As a rule in this theatre the back scene is only about a third
of the way down the stage, the figures appear in front of it and
are manipulated by men who stand on a platform behind, leaning
over a strong bar which runs along the top of the scene, their
heads, shoulders and arms being concealed by a piece of scenery
which falls just low enough.&nbsp; The entry into Jerusalem had
been prepared behind this back scene; it was a set group
representing Christ on the ass, surrounded by apostles carrying
palms, and was to be disclosed by the removal of the back scene,
the bar and the platform in front of which the meeting of the
Sanhedrin would be shown.</p>
<p>But I was not to witness the performance because Turiddu
Balistrieri wanted me to go to the Teatro Giacinta Pezzana and
see a special performance of <i>La Signora dalle Camelie</i> in
which he and some of his family, who are all artists, were to
take part.&nbsp; I could not go to both and chose Dumas because,
in the first place, being Turiddu&rsquo;s compare it was my duty
to support the family.&nbsp; In the second place I had seen the
Entry with Palms at the duomo in the morning and had all the rest
of the week free to see the marionettes do the rest of the
story.&nbsp; So I went to the Teatro Pezzana in the
evening.&nbsp; It is a small place, small enough to have been
formerly used for marionettes, and was now being used by a
Society of Lovers of the Drama.&nbsp; Turiddu was presiding over
the box-office and had considered my requirements.&nbsp; He sent
me in with his young brother Gennaro, who found me a place, and I
saw a play which cannot be considered seriously except as an <!--
page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>opportunity for the actress who undertakes the part of
Margherita Gautier.&nbsp; On this occasion it was undertaken by
Desdemona Balistrieri, Turiddu&rsquo;s sister, a girl of fifteen
years and ten months, two years older than himself; I had never
expected to see so young a Margherita Gautier.&nbsp; She gave a
remarkable performance with nothing childish about it and
nothing&mdash;but it would be unbecoming in me to praise the
sister of my compare.&nbsp; Her grandmother, the old lady
referred to in Chapter XVII (<i>ante</i>) who slept in the piazza
after the earthquake, was Prudenza, and her mother, Signora
Balistrieri, was Olimpia and appeared between the old generation
and the young, joining and yet separating them.&nbsp;
Turiddu&rsquo;s part was small; he was merely a page bringing a
letter or a message.</p>
<h4>MONDAY</h4>
<p>In the afternoon I went to the Teatro Sicilia and found
everything prepared for the evening.&nbsp; Christ and the
apostles were sitting at the supper-table as in Leonardo&rsquo;s
fresco in Milan; not that they were imitating Leonardo, the early
mosaics and the miracle plays, influencing and
counter-influencing one another, must have determined the
composition of the representations of the Last Supper before
Leonardo&rsquo;s time; he was not inventing, he was giving the
people something they were accustomed to see and the marionettes
were similarly following their own traditions.&nbsp; I do not
think the apostles were all in their usual places, S. John was
next to Christ, but Judas was at one end of the table&mdash;a
terrible fellow with shaggy black hair falling over his
face&mdash;and he had not spilt the salt.&nbsp; There was no salt
for him to spill.&nbsp; Signor Greco told me that when they
perform the Orioles play at Palermo, they use a horse-shoe table,
Judas sits near one end and not only spills the salt, but behaves
like a naughty child, putting his elbows on the table and
throwing the plates on the floor so that they break.&nbsp; On the
supper-table at Catania there <!-- page 264--><a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>was a
wooden model of a roasted lamb, with jointed neck and legs, lying
on a dish.&nbsp; There were plates with lettuces cut up, bread
and wine, oil and vinegar and oranges, all real.&nbsp; Each
apostle had a glass and there was a metal chalice for
Christ.&nbsp; I forget all the things that are on the table in
the chapel of the Last Supper at Varallo-Sesia, but I remember
they have ripe figs, which is a mistake, because figs do not
become ripe till later in the year.&nbsp; Oranges are at their
best in Sicily in the spring and lettuces are in season.&nbsp;
The audience understand this and know that lettuces are
appropriate for supper because they contain some narcotic, so
that a raw lettuce is often eaten after dinner.&nbsp; The supper
had been prepared in front of the back scene, and behind it,
ready to be disclosed at the proper moment, was the garden
wherein the capture of Christ was to take place.</p>
<p>Soon after seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening I was sitting in
my room at the albergo and saw a great light which I supposed
might have something to do with the electric tram.&nbsp; After
this I heard a roaring noise which I supposed might be occasioned
by an explosive motor bicycle in the street.&nbsp; Then the glass
in the window rattled for a considerable time, which I supposed
might be due to a slight shock of earthquake.&nbsp; At about
half-past eight I went to the Teatro Sicilia.&nbsp; Gregorio and
his assistants were all outside, and received me with
congratulations on my courage; I was the only one of their
patrons bold enough to think of witnessing the performance, all
the others had been too much frightened by the
earthquake&mdash;if it had been an earthquake; and in about ten
minutes we shut up the theatre and came away.&nbsp; I went to the
Teatro Machiavelli to see what effect had been produced
there.&nbsp; There was some anxiety about the phenomenon, but
more, it seemed, as to whether enough people would come to make
it worth while to have a performance.&nbsp; We were waiting for
instructions when someone brought in a bolletino hastily prepared
in a newspaper office with an account of the <!-- page 265--><a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>avvenimento
celeste.&nbsp; We sat round and listened while one of the actors
read about the convulsion of nature, the trembling of the
palaces, the flashes of flame at a great height in the sky, the
terror of the inhabitants of Catania.&nbsp; Was the phenomenon of
telluric origin&mdash;Etna or an earthquake?&nbsp; Was it of
atmospheric origin&mdash;a thunderbolt or a waterspout?&nbsp; Or
could it be a miracle in the dictionary sense of something
contrary to the course of nature?&nbsp; No one knew.&nbsp;
Gradually a sufficient number of the public overcame their fright
and took places in the theatre; and thus I saw a play by Peppino
Fazio called <i>I Delitti del Caporale</i> of which I have
forgotten a great deal, but it contained one incident which I
have not forgotten.</p>
<p>There was a scene in the cottage of a brigand who lived with
his sister, he was out and she was alone.&nbsp; A corporal of
infantry entered and made infamous proposals which she rejected;
a struggle followed and was ended by the man shooting the girl
through the heart.&nbsp; Overcome by remorse and filled with
respect for the dead, he reverently raised the corpse, laid it
along the floor by the wall at the back of the cottage and
covered it with a sheet.&nbsp; He placed an oil lamp on the floor
so that the head, the breast, the hips, the knees and the toes
caught the light, while shadows fell in the depressions
between.&nbsp; He knelt in prayer and then crept from the solemn
scene on which the curtain slowly descended.</p>
<p>We were then transported to a country road outside the caserma
of the carabinieri; they were carousing and plotting how to take
the brigand.&nbsp; A countryman came and gave information on
which they settled a plan of action and the scene ended, but it
had occupied a good deal of time and had distracted the mind.</p>
<p>The curtain rose again on the brigand&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp;
Nothing had been moved.&nbsp; Three carabinieri entered
furtively, they noticed what was on the floor, lying by the wall,
but did not disturb it, they had other business in hand and
concealed themselves behind doors and furniture.&nbsp; There was
<!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>a pause and the house was very still.&nbsp; The brigand
came home, noisily threw down his gun, clanked about the cottage
in his great boots, took his knife and his pistols from his belt
and banged them down on the table.&nbsp; As he turned he caught
sight of the sheet covering something the form of which was
emphasised by the oil lamp burning at its head.&nbsp; He did not
speak, but surprise and alarm seized him and appeared in his face
and in his attitude.&nbsp; He approached it, raised the sheet and
with a yell of terror and grief fell on his knees by the corpse
as he recognised his sister.&nbsp; The three carabinieri came
from their hiding and took him.</p>
<p>It was a typical drama for the Machiavelli.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the want of variety in their plots&mdash;and the
title of one of their plays signifies as little as the title of a
London pantomime&mdash;I have seldom passed an evening there
without seeing some incident as striking as this return to the
house of death.&nbsp; They know how to do these things with a
simplicity and an apparent unconsciousness of the effect they are
producing which bring with them a strange astonishment.</p>
<p>This was not the corporal&rsquo;s only crime, but to clear up
this one it may be added that the hand of the corpse clutched a
button which, in the struggle, the girl had torn off the
man&rsquo;s coat; this led to his identification, and in prison
he met the brigand, who shot him and thus avenged the
murder.&nbsp; I have seen happy endings that were more
artificial.</p>
<h4>TUESDAY</h4>
<p>Compare Turiddu came early to inquire whether I was much
alarmed by the disturbance and to tell me what had
happened.&nbsp; A bolide had fallen into the Catanian
sea&mdash;he took me to the port and showed me precisely
where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was near that ship,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The people had rushed to the cathedral to pray S. Agata <!--
page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>to avert further harm.&nbsp; They also went to the
Piazza S. Nicola hoping it might be large enough to hold them all
in case there was an earthquake, for they were all thinking of
Messina.&nbsp; The sailors, believing that what they saw fall
into the sea was the moon, drew their boats up into safety.&nbsp;
The sea did rise, but only eight centimetres, not so much as it
would have risen if the moon had really fallen into it.&nbsp;
When the newspapers came out I read more particulars: that a
barber in the Via Lincoln had been so much frightened that he cut
the throat of the customer he was shaving, fortunately, however,
no damage was done as the wound was only skin-deep; that a woman
ran naked into the Via Garibaldi, not having time in her fright
to put any clothes on; that a waiter handing a dish to a lady in
the Birraria Svizzera dropped it on her silk dress, which was
ruined; and that a priest in the Quattro Canti was seen moving
his arms like an electric fan and was heard to exclaim &ldquo;God
save me!&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not say &ldquo;God save us&rdquo;
because he was an egoist.</p>
<p>It should be added that the article was written by Peppino
Fazio, who confessed to me that though these things may have
happened he did not see them.&nbsp; He found them in his
imagination.&nbsp; It should perhaps be added further that he
knows his public and is not afraid of being taken seriously.</p>
<p>I also saw an account of an interview with Professor
Ricc&ograve; of the Observatory, who stated that an aerolite had
fallen out of the profundity of space and that it had not been
ascertained where it had struck our planet.</p>
<p>As no one had gone to the Teatro Sicilia on Monday the
marionettes were thrown a day late and the programme arranged for
the Monday was remanded to the Tuesday, like a festa.&nbsp; I
half feared I might be prevented again from seeing it because
some friends from England arrived in Catania for the night and I
did not know whether they would care to go.&nbsp; They were,
however, much interested when I made the proposal.&nbsp; We were
rather late, and <!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>missed the Last Supper, arriving
just before the curtain rose on the garden.&nbsp; It was a
beautiful scene.&nbsp; Christ was kneeling at a rock in the
background, the disciples were sleeping in the foreground and the
wings were hidden by branches of real trees.&nbsp; An angel
descended with a cup from which the principal figure drank.&nbsp;
When the angel had departed there was a pause&mdash;the lights
changed and through the silence we heard the tramp, tramp of
approaching people; soldiers came on preceded by Judas, who
betrayed his Master with a kiss, Peter cut off Malchus&rsquo;s
right ear, the Nazarene was taken and the curtain fell.</p>
<h4>WEDNESDAY</h4>
<p>Turiddu came in the morning and we conducted my friends round
the town.&nbsp; We went to the shop where the old Swiss
watchmaker sells the amber of which Brancaccia&rsquo;s necklace
is made; we went to the market, where we ate a prickly pear, just
to see what it was like, and the man politely refused payment
because we were foreigners; in the market also we bought bergamot
snuff-boxes; we then showed them the port, where they bought
crockery, and the Villa Bellini, where they took photographs;
after which we went back to the albergo, where we had
luncheon.&nbsp; Then we accompanied them to the station and saw
them off for Taormina.&nbsp; Turiddu was as pleased as anyone, he
liked making the acquaintance of his compare&rsquo;s English
friends and they thought him a delightful boy.&nbsp; Strictly
speaking they were not English; the two ladies were Inglesi
Americane, which Turiddu said he understood because his mother
had acted in the Argentina and, though South America is not North
America, it appeared pedantic to insist on the distinction.&nbsp;
The two gentlemen, again, were really Inglesi Irlandesi, and here
also we were in trouble because he mistook Irlandesi for Olandesi
and thought they were what we should call Boers.</p>
<p>After they had gone I went to the Teatro Sicilia to learn <!--
page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>what I had missed by not seeing the Cena.&nbsp; Carmelo
told me that when Christ has spoken the words &ldquo;This is my
body&rdquo; he breaks the bread and gives each of the apostles a
piece.&nbsp; Judas does not eat his piece, he steals it and
leaves the room.&nbsp; In his absence Christ blesses the wine and
gives the others to drink, he washes their feet and they go out
to the Mount of Olives.&nbsp; This is followed by a scene of
Judas coming to Annas and Caiaphas, showing his piece of bread
and telling them that he had heard Christ speak blasphemy.&nbsp;
Carmelo explained that the priests were Hebrews&mdash;there were
Hebrews, he said, in those days, living in that country&mdash;and
Hebrews believe that bread is the Body of God; therefore for a
man&mdash;and they thought Christ was merely a man&mdash;to
declare that the bread was his body amounted to blasphemy.&nbsp;
This was evidence against the Nazarene; it carried the story on a
step and the plotting priests prepared everything for the
betrayal and capture of Christ&mdash;the final scene which we
saw.</p>
<p>I did not know, or had forgotten, that Hebrews were so
particular about bread, but Carmelo assured me that they never
throw bread away, and if they find a piece on the floor they pick
it up and put it in a hole in the wall and keep it.&nbsp; It may
be eaten, but may never be otherwise destroyed.&nbsp; I thought
of Ruskin telling his readers in <i>The Elements of Drawing</i>
that stale crumb of bread is better than india-rubber to rub out
their mistakes, but &ldquo;it crumbles about the room and makes a
mess; and besides, you waste the good bread, which is wrong; and
your drawing will not for a long while be worth the crumbs.&nbsp;
So use india-rubber very lightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a Christian?&rdquo; asked Carmelo suddenly.</p>
<p>I was not embarrassed.&nbsp; A few days before, when one of
the priests at Tindaro asked me the same question, I replied that
I had been baptised into the Christian faith soon after
birth.&nbsp; The priest said that between the two Churches of
Rome and England there were unfortunate differences as to the
mysteries but I need not concern <!-- page 270--><a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>myself with
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nature does not believe in the
mysteries,&rdquo; said my priest, who was a most friendly person,
and as I had been baptised, if I lived a good life, and he was
politely certain I did, then I was a Christian.&nbsp; So I
considered myself justified in answering Carmelo&rsquo;s question
in the affirmative.</p>
<p>In the evening I returned to the Teatro Sicilia; Carmelo put
me into a good place and this time I saw the whole
performance.&nbsp; The Nazarene was taken before Annas, Caiaphas,
Pilate and Herod.&nbsp; The priests taxed him with being a
magician.&nbsp; Herod proposed that he should perform a miracle
if he could, but Christ was silent and did nothing.&nbsp; Herod
therefore concluded that the priests were wrong and that Christ
must be mad.&nbsp; He directed that he should be clothed in white
and taken back to Pilate, and this was done.</p>
<p>We were then in the house of the Madonna, and S. John came and
told her and the other Maries all that had happened to her
son.&nbsp; Each of the holy women carried a handkerchief and the
lamentation became monotonous.</p>
<p>Judas had received the thirty pieces of silver and began his
remorse by taking them, in a red purse, back to the priests, who
scoffed at him and turned him out.&nbsp; His rage and despair
were extreme and gave the audience an opportunity to relieve
their feelings by laughing.</p>
<p>Before the last scene Gregorio in his ordinary clothes came on
and told the audience the programme for the next day.&nbsp; He
also apologised for presenting the Passion with marionettes, he
usually performs it with living actors, he himself being the
Nazarene.&nbsp; This year, however, he did not feel strong enough
to undertake the part or to get all the other actors together;
and he appealed to our consideration and begged us to accept
marionettes.</p>
<p>In the days when Giovanni Grasso acted in his own Machiavelli
theatre, before he went on tour and acquired his world-wide
reputation, they used to do the Passion there also, and he was
Judas.&nbsp; Sometimes he doubled his <!-- page 271--><a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>part and
did Annas as well, or Pilate or the good centurion, making any
necessary alterations in those places where his two characters
ought to have appeared together.&nbsp; It would be a great thing
to see Giovanni as Judas, but I suppose he will never do it
again.</p>
<p>I noticed that all the figures had been newly dressed and
painted for the occasion and the pupils of their eyes were
freshly varnished to catch the light.&nbsp; About the soldiers
there was still some reminiscence of paladins, but the principal
characters had been prepared with due regard to the works of the
great masters&mdash;though here again I suppose they were really
following the traditions of the theatre as preserved by the
pictures.&nbsp; The figures gained by hiding their legs, but
Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a and Nicodemus had not this
advantage.&nbsp; They were princes and were like Shakespearean
young men of the brilliant water-fly type, such as Osric.&nbsp;
Misandro was also a prince.&nbsp; He was a swaggerer and behaved
as badly as any paladin, but he was not a buffo.&nbsp; When they
do the Nativit&agrave; at Christmas a buffo is permitted, he
accompanies the Shepherds as their servant, and I should like to
see him.&nbsp; Misandro was all in golden armour, as fine a
figure as one could expect a Prince of Jud&aelig;a to be.&nbsp;
He had a contrast in Claudio Cornelio the good centurion.&nbsp;
Claudio was left alone with Christ and confessed his faith, while
a bright light from the cinematograph box illuminated the stage
as though to signify that if we believe, all will become
clear.&nbsp; The most successful of the figures was Pilate.&nbsp;
He was in black with a red sash and his robes fell in folds of
great dignity.</p>
<p>The words were all declaimed either from memory or extempore,
and there were several speakers.&nbsp; The one who had most to do
did it with a great deal of energy, especially as Judas and
Misandro.&nbsp; Gregorio spoke for Christ and a woman spoke for
the women and the angels.</p>
<p>The Christ was of course a failure, in art all Christs are
failures, even the Christ in the chapels at Varallo-Sesia, even
the Christ in the pictures by the masters.&nbsp; The Child <!--
page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>Christ may be a success, at least we can sometimes
fancy that that baby might become the Saviour of the World, he
reminds us of those babies we have all seen in real life with a
look in their eyes as though they had solved the riddle of the
universe.&nbsp; But the Man Christ does not convince; we only
tolerate him because we have been brought up to acquiesce in the
convention.&nbsp; The Christs of pictures and statues are not,
however, such failures as the Christ at Ober-Ammergau; by keeping
still and not trying to appear so real they leave more to the
imagination.&nbsp; If all these fail how can a marionette be
expected to succeed?&nbsp; Hiding its legs when it moves is not
enough.&nbsp; Gregorio knew he was attempting the impossible and
did his best to save the figure from being worse than it might
have been, but the result was rather as though it were all the
time apologising for having undertaken the part.&nbsp; He made it
move very little and very slowly, so slowly that the action of
the drama was interrupted.&nbsp; He allowed it no gestures,
except an occasional raising of the hand.&nbsp; He spoke for it
only the few words given to Christ in the gospels.&nbsp; When it
caused a miracle, there came a great light, as when the good
centurion confessed his faith, and there was music.&nbsp; When it
entered, the drum beat a Saracen rhythm and there was music
again.&nbsp; By these means the figure was detached from the
others and appeared as though belonging to another world.&nbsp;
When the marionettes do the Orioles play at Palermo, Christ
speaks much more than the words from the gospels and is treated
more like one of the other characters, at least nothing is done
to suggest that they are giving the Passion with the part of
Christ as nearly omitted as possible.</p>
<p>The music at Catania was faint and scrappy.&nbsp;
Gounod&rsquo;s <i>Meditation on Bach&rsquo;s First Prelude</i>
occurred frequently, but it seldom got beyond the first ten or
twelve bars, sometimes not beyond the second or third.&nbsp; And
there were similar short references to some of the more
sentimental melodies of Bellini and Verdi.&nbsp; It was not
intended to distract the <!-- page 273--><a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>attention;
it was rather to provide an unobtrusive background for the ear
against which the voice spoke, as the scenery was a background
for the eye against which the figures moved.</p>
<h4>THURSDAY</h4>
<p>This was the day for visiting the sepulchres in the
churches.&nbsp; Turiddu took me to the cathedral, and we saw a
procession moving slowly down the nave.&nbsp; It turned up one of
the aisles and entered a sepulchre which had been prepared,
passing between a double file of dismal creatures entirely
shrouded in white except for two eye-holes, like those ghouls
that issued stealthily from charnel-houses in German fairy tales,
and used to pursue me in dreams when I was a boy.&nbsp; One by
one the lights on the altar were extinguished, Phrygian cadences
dropped inconclusively from the choir above, the archbishop came
out of the sepulchre and the hooded ghosts crept with him.&nbsp;
A Dominican occupied the pulpit and began a sermon, but as we
could not get near enough to hear what he said, we came
away.&nbsp; Turiddu afterwards took me to visit a few more
sepulchres, and it was a gloomy business.</p>
<p>In the evening, at the Teatro Sicilia, the curtain rose on
Christ bound to the column, and there were two Turks armed with
scourges.&nbsp; They did not actually scourge him, it was enough
that they told Misandro they had executed their orders.&nbsp;
Peter denied his master and the cock crew thrice.&nbsp; While
Judas was continuing his remorse, Peter appeared to him, and,
confessing his sin of denying Christ, proposed to expiate it by
throwing himself into a well; he tempted Judas to follow his
example and preceded him to show the way.&nbsp; But we saw that
it was not really Peter, it was a devil.&nbsp; Judas was about to
follow the devil when an angel appeared and stopped him.&nbsp; He
was to die a different death, and not yet.</p>
<p>A tearful scene between mother and son came next; I <!-- page
274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>did not care for it, but the dream of Claudia, the wife
of Pilate, was, as Carmelo said, &ldquo;una visione
tremenda.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a dress of scarlet satin trimmed with
gold and lace, she sat in an arm-chair in a garden and went to
sleep.&nbsp; Christ appeared to her.&nbsp; She spoke to him, but
he did not reply, and as she woke he vanished.&nbsp; She slept
again, and Annas appeared to her in red fire, threatening her if
she yielded to the emotions which the vision of the Man of
Sorrows had raised in her heart.&nbsp; She woke in dismay as he
vanished.&nbsp; She slept again, and saw Pilate in hell
surrounded by devils.&nbsp; She woke in fright.&nbsp; She slept
again, and a devil appeared and talked to her, justifying
Pilate.&nbsp; S. Michele came and killed the devil.</p>
<h4>GOOD FRIDAY</h4>
<p>The Machiavelli was closed.&nbsp; At the Sicilia the
performance began with the trial of Christ.&nbsp; Pilate sat in
the middle with Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a and Nicodemus on his
right, Caiaphas, Annas, and Misandro on his left.&nbsp; Beyond
Nicodemus was the Nazarene in a red cloak holding a reed and
crowned with thorns; and beyond Misandro was Barabbas.&nbsp;
Pilate made the opening speech.&nbsp; Caiaphas then spoke for the
prosecution; the question in debate was whether Christ was the
Son of God, and he accused Christ of being a deceiver.&nbsp;
Nicodemus followed for the defence.&nbsp; Then Annas for the
prosecution.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;The voice of God is the voice
of the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was followed by Joseph, who
maintained that the wonders performed by Christ were not done by
magic, they were miracles; that is he was not a magician, he was
the Son of God.&nbsp; Misandro spoke last.</p>
<p>Here a messenger arrived from Claudia telling her dream and
begging Pilate to go to her.&nbsp; The Court rose and Pilate went
home to comfort his wife, while the others talked among
themselves just as barristers do in the Royal Courts of Justice
in the Strand when the sitting is suspended.</p>
<p><!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>Pilate returned and took his seat.&nbsp; He proposed to
liberate Christ and to sacrifice Barabbas.&nbsp; He presented
Christ to the people, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ecce Homo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the crowd shouted: &ldquo;Not this man, but
Barabbas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pilate ironically congratulated them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, O ignorant People!&rdquo; and, telling
Barabbas to go and thieve again, he liberated him.</p>
<p>Then the false witnesses came.&nbsp; One was a soldier, the
other a Turk.&nbsp; They took the oath to speak the truth and
nothing but the truth.&nbsp; They were both of them stupid and
comic, confused and contradictory, and made the audience laugh,
and when one of them admitted that he had been bribed, Annas in
his rage gobbled like a turkey.</p>
<p>Pilate closed the debate and washed his hands in a basin held
by a servant.&nbsp; Then he wrote the sentence and made Misandro
read it.&nbsp; The trial lasted a whole hour, the intention
being, I suppose, to reproduce that tediousness which is so
characteristic of real trials.</p>
<p>In the next scene Judas continued his remorse and
Peter&mdash;it was really Peter this time&mdash;came and
counselled him to ask pardon of Jesus, but he would not
listen.</p>
<p>Then came the journey to Calvary and the meeting with the
Daughters of Jerusalem and S. Veronica, Misandro ill-treating the
women and Claudio Cornelio protecting them.</p>
<p>The last scene was the Crucifixion.&nbsp; The thieves were in
place.&nbsp; At the back was the Cross lying on the ground.&nbsp;
The figure of Christ was nailed to it by a Turk with a hammer;
the Cross was raised; Misandro approved; the Turk gave the
sponge; Misandro reviled Christ, saying: &ldquo;Thou that
destroyest the temple of God and buildest it in three days, save
thyself&rdquo;; Christ and the thieves held their dialogue; the
Madonna and S. John stood at the foot of the Cross while Christ
spoke the sentences and inclined his head.&nbsp; Then there was
the earthquake, and we saw the souls in purgatory surrounding the
Cross and heard them welcoming their Lord.</p>
<h4><!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>SATURDAY</h4>
<p>Compare Turiddu came early and we went to the duomo to see the
Gloria.&nbsp; The church was full and he told me to be careful
about my watch and my money because&mdash;&ldquo;picketi
pocketi&rdquo;; and then he asked me whether I understood those
two words which his mother had brought back from one of her
tours.</p>
<p>His Eminence, the Cardinal Archbishop, was conducting a
service in a side chapel&mdash;blessing the baptismal water, or
the font, or both, or perhaps doing something else, for Turiddu
is not such an authority on ecclesiastical matters as Carmelo is
on matters theatrical.&nbsp; He knows more than I do, however; it
was he who made me go to see the Gloria on the Saturday, without
him I should have missed it by waiting till the Sunday.&nbsp; The
western doors were thrown open and we looked through into the
sunshine and up to the arch that stands at the top of the Via
Garibaldi.&nbsp; The archbishop finished his service and returned
through the congregation to the space within the rails of the
principal altar.&nbsp; Behind him as he stood and concealing the
altar and the east end of the church hung a curtain from the roof
to the floor.&nbsp; There was chanting and movement among the
priests; they continually kept going and coming, disappearing
into the secret place behind the great curtain and reappearing;
they were preparing the mystery.&nbsp; Presently the curtain
shook and the congregation understood.&nbsp; The suppressed
excitement grew and a murmuring began, caused, I suppose, by
everyone telling everyone else, as Turiddu told me, that the
curtain was about to fall.&nbsp; Another instant&mdash;and its
fall revealed the Gloria.</p>
<p>Above the altar was a tomb and above the tomb was the figure
of the risen Christ triumphing over death; in his left hand he
held a banner and, with his right, he blessed the people.&nbsp;
There were lights, and sudden music from the organ and from the
choir; the deafening bells clanged and, through the great open
doors, we heard the sound of <!-- page 277--><a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>revolvers
being shot off into the air and of fireworks being exploded.</p>
<p>Turiddu could not see over the heads of the people; I lifted
him up, he looked at the Gloria and turning himself round in my
arms kissed me as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buona Pasqua, Compare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone was saying &ldquo;Buona Pasqua&rdquo; to everyone
else, everyone standing near a friend or a relation was
exchanging kisses with him or her as a sign of goodwill; many
were weeping for joy, and those who had been quarrelling became
reconciled, forgiving one another their offences and entering
upon a new life, vowing that, with the help of their Heavenly
Father, who had revealed to them the Mystery of the Resurrection,
they would from this day avoid all further disputes even though,
in order to perform the vow, it should be necessary to avoid one
another&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; This is not imaginative writing,
like Peppino Fazio&rsquo;s account of the effect of the bolide,
it is what I saw&mdash;the effect of the Gloria.</p>
<p>And the spirit of the Gloria floated down the nave and through
the open doors and out into the piazza, where the elephant of
lava stands over the fountain.&nbsp; It passed up the Via
Garibaldi, down the Corso, along the Stesicoro Etnea, it spread
itself through the city and became identified with the morning
sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Turiddu, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go
and buy a paschal lamb for mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We followed the Gloria into the piazza among the fireworks and
the revolvers.</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;What about the plates, Turiddu?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t the people throw the crockery out of window in their
joy?&nbsp; We must be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied that they only do that in the poorer parts of the
town, and they always look first to make sure that no one is
passing.&nbsp; But we had better be careful, all the same,
because the revolvers are loaded and the squibs are
dangerous.</p>
<p><!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>He took me past the municipio, where the band was
playing, and we came to a sweet-shop, where paschal lambs made of
almond paste and sugar were flocking together on all the tables
and shelves.&nbsp; They were not like the one at the Last Supper,
they were in their fleeces and were standing or lying among
candied fruits and tufts of dried grass that had been
artificially dyed unlikely colours.&nbsp; Turiddu chose one, and
I sent him off home with it as an Easter offering of goodwill to
his mother.</p>
<p>Peppino Fazio was standing at a kiosk near the Quattro Canti
with two young cousins, buying button-holes of violas; he gave me
the one he had intended for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wear this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is the
primavera.&nbsp; Proserpine has risen from the underworld, she
has returned to Enna and is scattering flowers again.&nbsp; Stay;
let us exchange; I will take another bunch and you shall pay the
man for it one soldo.&nbsp; Buona Pasqua.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we exchanged bunches.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wear this,&rdquo; I
said, echoing his words, &ldquo;it is the primavera; the time for
visiting sepulchres is over.&nbsp; Proserpine has sent these
flowers down from Castrogiovanni by the morning train.&nbsp;
Buona Pasqua.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the next piazza, in the shadow of the statue of Bellini,
was one of the men from the Teatro Machiavelli; he had brought
out his dog and talked of going a-birding, he hoped it was not
too early for quail, he had already seen ripe strawberries in the
market.&nbsp; Buona Pasqua.</p>
<p>Then I came upon Joe, the Policeman, keeping order in the
street.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Buona Pasqua.&nbsp; You are very good-looking
this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; He meant I was looking very well, but
he will be so English.</p>
<p>I replied: &ldquo;Buona Pasqua.&nbsp; But, my dear Joe, you
ought not to be wearing flowers in uniform, ought you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the primavera,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He also told
me that the revolvers and the squibs and the plates had not done
<!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>much damage this year&mdash;perhaps ten or a dozen
accidents, but none fatal, so far as was yet known.</p>
<p>I went along the Via Stesicoro, not considering my steps
because I was looking up the street, wondering how long the
Gloria would take to melt the snow on Etna, and I stumbled across
Carmelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buona Pasqua, Carmelo, and have you been to church this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he had been to the port with his friends to see the
steamer in which they were to go to Naples; there they would
change into another steamer and be taken to the States.&nbsp;
They had begged, borrowed, stolen, or, it may be, possibly even
earned enough soldi to begin their new life upon another soil and
under other skies in a new world.&nbsp; Buona Pasqua.</p>
<p>I returned to the albergo and found that Turiddu had been and
had left for me a characteristic Sicilian cake&mdash;a ring of
bread on one side of which, half embedded in the pasta, were four
new-laid eggs.&nbsp; This was accompanied by a note from his
mother begging me to accept it as her Easter offering of
goodwill.&nbsp; She was telling me more than that the hens had
begun to lay again.&nbsp; She was reminding me of how I had seen
her at the Teatro Pessana as the link between her mother and her
children, joining them and separating them like a passage of
modulation.&nbsp; I understood her to mean that for the future I
was to see an egg as a transitional something between the hen
that laid it and the chicken that will burst from its shell, as a
secret place of repose where the one is transmuted into the
other, as a sacred temple wherein is prepared a mystery of
resurrection.&nbsp; Mothers know some things that cannot be told
except in symbolism, and not very clearly then, symbols being as
perplexing as unresolved diminished sevenths which may be
understood in many different senses.&nbsp; I read the riddle of
the eggs in the sense suggested by the context of the Gloria, and
I think I read it aright, for in Catania on that Easter morning
we were all of one mind, we were all <!-- page 280--><a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>breathing
the Gloria, we were all filled with the spirit of the new life,
the spirit that animated also our far-away English monk as he sat
in his Berkshire cell making music for</p>
<blockquote><p>Summer is icumen in,<br />
Lhude sing cuccu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the evening I went to the Machiavelli.&nbsp; The theatre
had been taken by a young amateur who carries on a business of
forwarding oranges and other fruit.&nbsp; He gave a performance
of one of Giovanni Grasso&rsquo;s plays, <i>Feudalismo</i>, part
of which I was obliged to see because in the second act there is
a song sung behind, and Turiddu had been asked to sing it; on
such a day the claims of the family were stronger even than on
Palm Sunday.&nbsp; His voice has not yet broken, but if it turns
out to be as good for a man as it is now for a boy, he ought to
do well with it.&nbsp; I must not continue&mdash;it would be more
unbecoming in me to praise my compare for his singing than to
praise his sister for her acting.</p>
<p>After the song in <i>Feudalismo</i> there was time also for
the second representation at the Teatro Sicilia.&nbsp; The
performance began with the wounding of Christ.&nbsp; Then Annas
and Caiaphas discussed the question of whether, after all, they
might not have made a mistake in treating Christ as a
magician.&nbsp; They had been alarmed by the earthquake, the
atmospheric disturbances and the rising of the dead from their
graves.&nbsp; Could these phenomena signify that he was the Son
of God?&nbsp; And something else troubled them; on consideration
they did not like the wording of Pilate&rsquo;s sentence.&nbsp;
They went to his palace, but Pilate was not disposed to listen to
their objections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I have written I have written,&rdquo; said
Pilate.</p>
<p>They had brought the sentence with them and pointed out to him
that he had condemned &ldquo;il Re dei Giudei&rdquo; the King of
the Jews and, inasmuch as condemning a king is a serious step and
might get him into trouble, <!-- page 281--><a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>suggested
that for his own safety he should add the letter &ldquo;o&rdquo;
to the word &ldquo;Re.&rdquo;&nbsp; This would make it that he
had condemned &ldquo;Il Reo dei Giudei,&rdquo; the Criminal of
the Jews.&nbsp; Pilate was persuaded and agreed to add the
letter.&nbsp; He went away and fetched his pen, which looked like
a feather from the tail of a hawk, and Annas held the paper; but
Pilate&rsquo;s pen refused to write, it was wafted from his hand
by a power stronger than his, it hung in the air before their
eyes and fluttered away to heaven.</p>
<p>This miracle was accompanied by music; and, if I had been
consulted, I should not have advised the <i>Marcia Reale
Italiana</i>, because that composition, on account of its
inherent frivolity, has always seemed to me unfit for the
accompaniment of any manifestation of power.&nbsp; To despise
Bellini because he is not Schubert would be to adopt the attitude
of the buffo&rsquo;s critic who escaped from Paris in the
teatrino at Palermo; nevertheless the countrymen of Schubert have
known how to appear before the world clothed in the solemn
splendour of Haydn&rsquo;s majestic Hymn to the Emperor, while
the Italians come mountebanking along in an ill-fitting,
machine-made suit of second-hand flourishes, as though that were
the best they could lay their hands on.&nbsp; They have not done
themselves justice.&nbsp; But this is not the place for a
digression; before returning to Pilate and his visitors, however,
let me say distinctly that the music was the Italian <i>Marcia
Reale</i> played, not as the other scraps were played, but with a
loud and jaunty heartlessness as though the miraculous pen were
jeering at the priests:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! you didn&rsquo;t expect that; now, did
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph and Nicodemus also came to Pilate begging the body of
Jesus.&nbsp; The priests objected, for they had not forgotten the
prophecy about building the Temple of God in three days, and they
feared trickery.&nbsp; Pilate compromised, granting the request
but setting a guard.</p>
<p>Next we saw the Descent from the Cross, effected by Joseph and
Nicodemus; and while the body lay on a <!-- page 282--><a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>couch, a
melancholy Miserere was sung behind.&nbsp; The Entombment
followed, the Madonna in black lamenting and weeping.</p>
<p>The last scene was in a wood, where Judas came to finish his
remorse.&nbsp; He refused all comfort and all the benevolent
suggestions of the angels who visited him.&nbsp; They told him
that God is ever willing to pardon the sinner who sincerely
repents and freely confesses his sin.&nbsp; It is with God always
as it is with men at the season of the Gloria.&nbsp; But the
wretched Judas could not think of repentance and confession; his
cowardly soul was not torn by sorrow for past sin, it was
paralysed by fear of future punishment; or we may have been
intended to understand that the road to perdition lies through
madness.&nbsp; He spoke three sentences, and the last word of
each was echoed by a diabolical voice and then appeared written
in letters of blood and
fire:&mdash;Giuda:&mdash;Dio:&mdash;Stesso.&nbsp; These words
made a sentence by themselves and signified: &ldquo;<i>Judas</i>
is against <i>God</i> and against <i>Himself</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Faith, Hope, and Charity appeared to him separately; he would
have nothing to do with any of them and they all deserted
him.&nbsp; A devil approached and Judas trembled, knowing his
time had come.&nbsp; He went and fetched a rope, and with the
devil&rsquo;s help accomplished his fatal destiny by hanging
himself to one of the trees of the wood, and as his wicked soul
came out of his mouth the devil greedily snatched it away and
carried it down to be eternally tormented in hell.&nbsp; It was
like an untidy black hen.</p>
<h4>EASTER DAY</h4>
<p>I had to go into the country for the night, and so was obliged
to miss the Resurrection as presented by the marionettes.&nbsp; I
did not, however, much mind, because I had seen the Gloria in the
cathedral, where the Christ over the altar was modelled much
better than any figure in the theatre.&nbsp; Besides, I called on
Gregorio in the course of the <!-- page 283--><a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>day and had
a talk with him and his son, Angiolino, who told me what is done
on the last evening of the drama, and showed me the
preparations.&nbsp; The first scene, representing the tomb, was
nearly ready.&nbsp; After the curtain rises there is an
earthquake, and Misandro comes to see whether the watching
soldiers are doing their duty; he finds them asleep and wakes
them.&nbsp; This is repeated, and the third time Misandro sees
the tomb open with a loud noise and a bright
light&mdash;&ldquo;like the bolide,&rdquo; said Angiolino.&nbsp;
Christ rises, and Misandro, seeing the actual Resurrection, is
convinced that Christ is the Son of God and not a magician; he
goes to spend the rest of his life preaching the gospel among the
heathen.&nbsp; I did not ask what music accompanies the miracle
of the Resurrection; I confess I was afraid to do so after what I
had heard accompanying the flight of the pen.&nbsp; If I had been
consulted here I should have advised silence to suggest that no
music could be found suitable for the tremendous mystery that was
being accomplished.&nbsp; But I do not think such advice would
have been accepted.</p>
<p>Then Herod is ill and commands Pilate to send Jesus to cure
him.&nbsp; Pilate commands the priests to produce Jesus,
reminding them that he had washed his hands; but each of the
priests accuses the other of being responsible, and so they enter
upon their eternal punishment of mutual recrimination.</p>
<p>Christ appears to the Magdalene, to Luke, to Matthew and to a
contadino.&nbsp; He takes two of them to a tavern, where he
breaks bread and vanishes.&nbsp; So they recognise him and go to
tell the good news to the Madonna and the other holy women.&nbsp;
Doubting Thomas is convinced.&nbsp; Jesus breathes the Holy
Spirit upon them and they receive the gift of tongues.&nbsp; The
last scene is the Ascension, and Christ as he is received into
heaven speaks words of comfort to his mother, telling her it will
not be long before she joins him.</p>
<p>The marionettes were behindhand with their Gloria, because the
bolide having transferred Monday&rsquo;s programme <!-- page
284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>to
Tuesday had syncopated the succeeding performances into
counterpoint of the fourth order, and everything that happened
after that was one beat late.&nbsp; Had they moved concurrently
with the Church, and reached the Resurrection on the Saturday,
they would have repeated it on the Sunday to fill up the time
till Easter Monday, when they were to return to <i>Erminio della
Stella d&rsquo;Oro</i>, a story of romance and chivalry invented
by Angelo Grasso, the father of Gregorio and of Giovanni.</p>
<p>I asked Gregorio where he had found the particulars for
Misandro and the remorse of Judas and for the dream of
Pilate&rsquo;s wife and the pen that flew away.&nbsp; He replied
that he did not know where they came from, they are traditional
in the theatre and had probably come out of the libraries.&nbsp;
As to Judas and the angel preventing him from drowning himself in
the well, I asked whether they have in Sicily the saying about a
man being born to be hanged and whether any allusion was
intended.&nbsp; Angiolino said they have such a saying, or
something like it, but it had never occurred to him to suppose
that any allusion was intended, it might be so, but he thought
not.</p>
<p>The Christ that had been prepared for the Resurrection in the
Teatro Sicilia was not the marionette that had been on the Cross;
the stigmata were there, the spear wound was wanted in the scene
with Thomas, and the people were free to take it as being the
same figure with all the other marks of suffering removed, or
they might think it was a different one, or they might come
behind the scenes and find out for themselves as I did.&nbsp;
Dwellers in another planet, if they watch the recurrence of the
mystery of our spring, may think the flowers they saw sinking
into the earth last autumn return again with the marks of decay
removed, they cannot come behind our scenes and make sure; but we
know that a new generation is born.&nbsp; The marionettes are not
didactic; if the people choose to see in the Resurrection of
Christ any one of Nature&rsquo;s ageless mysteries they may do
so; they may see the birth of the <!-- page 285--><a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>younger
generation, the blossoming of fresh flowers after winter, the
awakening to a new day after sleep; or, if they prefer it, they
may see the resurrection of their own dead bodies at the sound of
the Last Trump&mdash;one of those mysteries in which, as my
priest at Tindaro told me, Nature does not believe, and with
which I need not concern myself.</p>
<p>I do not think they saw in it any of these meanings.&nbsp; At
Ober-Ammergau the play is presented so that Mendelssohn need not
have hesitated to advise the late Prince Consort to honour a
performance with his presence.&nbsp; In the Teatro Sicilia other
tastes have to be consulted.&nbsp; I think the audience looked on
at the Passion of Christ as they are accustomed to look on at
<i>I Delitti del Caporale</i> or <i>Feudalismo</i> or at the
<i>Story of the Paladins</i> or <i>Erminio della Stella
d&rsquo;Oro</i>; if they suspected any symbolism or mystery, the
melodrama with which they were saturated provided a context that
determined the direction of the resolution.&nbsp; They saw wicked
priests conspiring with a cowardly traitor and an overbearing
bully to bring about the destruction of an innocent man.&nbsp;
They saw the innocent man passing through misfortune and in the
end triumphing over his enemies by means of a happy ending, which
reminded them of the happy ending of a Machiavelli play, when the
hero returns from prison and the bad people are punished.&nbsp;
They saw a mother weeping for her son, but they saw no allusion
to Ceres weeping for loss of Proserpine, although their
Castrogiovanni was her Enna&mdash;just as Angiolino saw no
reference to Judas having been born to be hanged, although they
have the saying in Sicily, and he is the son of the house.&nbsp;
I do not think they saw any significance in the fact that this
mystery of the Death and Resurrection of the God is repeated
every spring.&nbsp; I imagine that the point made by Joseph of
Arimath&aelig;a in his speech for the defence, that the wonders
done by Christ on earth were miracles and were not occasioned by
magic, was lost upon them.&nbsp; It would take a long time to
make one of them <!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>understand that la Durlindana, the
sword of Orlando, was a magical sword and not a miraculous
one.&nbsp; And yet this distinction between miracle and magic was
the pivot of the plot as it was presented to them.&nbsp; If they
had felt themselves lifted out of their ordinary routine I do not
think they would have done what they did after the curtain had
fallen on the section of the story presented each evening.</p>
<p>At the Machiavelli they are accustomed to remain for the farce
and the Canzonettisti Napoletani which close the performance; so
at the Sicilia they remain for the cinematograph.&nbsp; Every
evening during Holy Week the programme posted up at the door
concluded with these words &ldquo;Indi Cinematografo,&rdquo; and
there were always three parts to the show.&nbsp; First there was
cruelty&mdash;victorious tyrants forcing conquered queens to
drink their lovers&rsquo; blood, or some horror of the
Inquisition, or the barrel of Regulus bumping down-hill and
coming to smash at the bottom.&nbsp; The second part was a modern
comedy carried on in Parisian drawing-rooms or on board an
electric launch on an American river.&nbsp; The third part was
always a wild farce and usually contained an impossible
chase.&nbsp; Not till after the cinematograph had concluded its
show did the audience go away contented.</p>
<h2><!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span

<h3>CHAPTER XXII<br />
O FOUNTAIN ARETHUSE</h3>
<p>When &ldquo;Arethusa arose From her couch of snows In the
Acroceraunian mountains&rdquo; she had scarcely reached the age
at which women begin to dream of love.&nbsp; She spied the
approaching river-god Alpheus and, to preserve what was dearer to
her than life, for she was a nymph of Diana, plunged heroically
into the earth.&nbsp; Alpheus, who had reached the age when men
desire to act, plunged in after her.&nbsp; They flowed along
inside the ground and under the sea, he following her, all the
way from Greece to Sicily and, according to the recognised habit
of gods and demi-gods believed to be dead and buried, they rose
again.&nbsp; The place of Arethusa&rsquo;s resurrection is the
island of Ortigia, but, although I have the story from the
fountain head, it all happened so long ago that I have not been
able to ascertain whether Alpheus rose there or at a spot on the
mainland of Sicily nearer Etna where S. Alfio is the patron
saint, and although the &ldquo;e&rdquo; in Alpheus takes the
stress and the &ldquo;i&rdquo; in Alfio does not, nevertheless,
the custode of the spring, who was himself my informant, may
confuse the two names.&nbsp; The difference between the versions
is that between tragedy and comedy.&nbsp; If they, the pursued
and her pursuer, rose in the same place it can hardly be that he
did not catch her.&nbsp; If he rose somewhere else, then she may
still preserve her everlasting virginity and they will neither of
them ever reach the age when experience teaches both men and
women to regret.&nbsp; She will be ever flying, he ever pursuing,
like the maiden and the lover on that Grecian Urn which an
eminent authority, baffled in his attempts at identification,

290</span>I possess a Bible and Prayer-book bound together in one
volume which was given me on leaving Rottingdean by my sincere
friend, the master of the preparatory school there.&nbsp; It
contains, just before the First Chapter of Genesis, a
Chronological Map &ldquo;with remarkable persons and events
collaterally placed.&rdquo;&nbsp; I remember how I used to
mitigate the tedium of divine service by reading to myself that
the creation of the world occupied one of the weeks of the year
4004 B.C.; that Egypt was founded about 2190 B.C.; that Troy fell
about 1180 B.C., seventy years or so before the birth of King
David; and that Homer and Elijah flourished contemporaneously
between 1000 and 900 B.C.&nbsp; My schoolmaster wrote my name in
the book with a suitable inscription and a reference to Psalm
cxix. 105.&nbsp; I turned up the passage and drew the conclusion
that he desired his gift to be a lantern unto my feet and a light
unto my paths.&nbsp; And so it was until other knowledge, the
rudiments of which he had himself endeavoured to impart to me,
threw glimmerings across my way and I passed through a distracted
period of inability to distinguish the signals of danger from
those of safety.&nbsp; Much the same thing has happened to many
others and assistance has sometimes been found in compromise and
accommodation.&nbsp; Thus the statement about 4004 B.C., when
read by the light of another statement in the Book, does not
seriously conflict with the teachings of modern science.&nbsp;
Until further knowledge shall eclipse the few feeble lanterns
that are now doing their best to illuminate my course I shall
continue to hold the opinion that, as in the sight of Him, who is
the Life of the Universe, a thousand years are but as yesterday,
so in the sight of man, who has been God&rsquo;s image upon earth
for more ages than anyone can tell, six thousand years are but as
last week.&nbsp; And I shall keep my thousands in a condition as
elastic as may be necessary to bear any stretching that future
discoveries may put upon them.</p>
<p>It was many thousands of such weeks ago, when Mother <!-- page
291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>Earth was herself in her infancy, before her baby bones
had hardened, that Arethusa first came to the island she has made
her home.&nbsp; She is still coming and can be seen to-day still
rising as fresh as ever.&nbsp; The story of the early days of her
exile was not told by Clio because Clio was only a modern
Agamemnon in history, many a brave muse had flourished before she
was thought of.&nbsp; One of them took for her infinite papyrus
the firmament of space, those heavens which shall one day be
rolled together as a scroll, whereon she inscribed chapters in
stars and volumes in constellations.&nbsp; We cannot see all her
works, nor can we read all we see, but we know that she put us
into one of her books.&nbsp; A few paragraphs of that chapter
which forms our planet lie scattered around Siracusa; we
recognise her manuscript in the shape of the Great Harbour, in
the depth of the sea, in the height of the hills, in the strata
of the rocks, in the soil, in the vegetation.</p>
<p>There were early muses who employed flint implements and
arrow-heads for records, and neglected to clear away the remains
of prehistoric meals in caverns.&nbsp; Others preferred to write
their chronicles upon pots, urns and tombs or to scrawl placid
monosyllables upon polygonal walls.&nbsp; But with all their
industry the muses have never been able to keep pace with the
material that has accumulated round the dwellings of men and
women.&nbsp; They have done their best and, when their mother
Mnemosyne began to fail and the business was split up first into
three, then four, seven, eight, and ultimately into nine
departments, it was hoped that a better result would be shown;
but they have never had an adequate allowance, and have always
been in financial difficulties, besides which they have disagreed
among themselves, and quarrelling wastes time.</p>
<p>Clio in her matter-of-fact way built a storehouse wherein to
preserve her treasures; her curious, imaginative sisters peeped
through the key-hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; they said to one another.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a <!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>collection!&nbsp; Do you think we
could get inside and see it properly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited till Clio went one day with Neptune to pay a visit
to the Ethiopians &ldquo;who lie in two halves, one half looking
on to the Atlantic and the other on to the Indian Ocean,&rdquo;
they induced Vulcan to come and pick the lock for them and soon
they were roaming all over the palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How admirably arranged!&rdquo; exclaimed one of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be nearly exhaustive!&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe the collateral placing of remarkable persons
and events,&rdquo; said a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One could find almost anything one wanted,&rdquo; said
a fourth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; they exclaimed; &ldquo;oh! now if only we
could manage to get a little life into some of these dead bones,
how pleased Clio would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rifled the show-cases and carried off the most attractive
details, each taking whatever pleased her best.&nbsp; They stole
from Clio her transient facts and made them live again as their
own by breathing into them the spirit of eternal truth and
re-stating them in folk-lore, in tradition, in verse, in romance,
in melody, in superstition, in outline, in colour, in modelling,
in the movements of the dance; they set them up in libraries, in
concert-rooms, in picture-galleries, in theatres, in churches, in
corridors of sculpture, in the hearts of the people.&nbsp; This
was not what Clio had intended; she was not at all pleased; she
complained that her sisters had meddled, they had robbed her of
her chief possessions and left the remainder in disorder; her
collection no longer corresponded with the catalogue.&nbsp; In
attempting to reconstruct she floundered into such blunders that
the saying has come down to us: Blessed are the people that have
no history, for they shall not be misrepresented.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, of course, every man has history, such as
it is, and the beatitude was intended to refer only to those
whose history has escaped the attention of the muses <!-- page
293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>as
that of Arethusa did for many ages.&nbsp; We know enough,
however, to guess that her exile cannot have been passed in
solitude and, if only we had her Visitors&rsquo; Book complete,
we should have something that would keep many learned persons
busy.&nbsp; We get an early glimpse of her on her underground
journey, passing near enough to the dread abode of Pluto to
overhear some scandal about</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
fair field<br />
Of Enna where Proserpine, gathering flowers,<br />
Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis<br />
Was gathered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She did not fully understand, but the nymph Cyane, who dwelt
in another fountain up the river Anapo and remembered the affair,
gave her full particulars; she made a mental note of it all and
imparted the information to Ceres, who came weeping and telling
her grief as she wandered the world in search of her lost
daughter.</p>
<p>Venus, in one or other of her manifestations, was and is a
welcome visitor; she rises from the sea as constantly as Arethusa
falls into it, and some little time ago gave the nymph, for a
keepsake, a portrait of herself as Venere Anadiomene done in
marble.&nbsp; I know enough about painting not to be afraid to
own that I know nothing about it, whereas with regard to
sculpture my ignorance is so unfathomable that I can have no
hesitation in saying what I think about this statue, which is
that it is a pity it has been broken.&nbsp; If only it had its
head and its right arm it would be an entry of which the owner of
any visitors&rsquo; book might well be proud.&nbsp; It is now in
the museum of Ortigia, where there is also a marble portrait of
Cupid as he comes riding into the Great Harbour mounted on his
dolphin&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Diana, sailing through the night, seated in her silver chair,
comes regularly to Ortigia.&nbsp; Arethusa always receives her
with the respect and honour due to her Queen and Huntress, chaste
and fair.&nbsp; Some centuries ago she <!-- page 294--><a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>built her a
temple with Doric columns and everything handsome about it; she
put inside it a statue of the goddess, and the people forsook
their old deity, whatever she was called, and went to the new
temple worshipping Diana.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;nician traders came and did business with Arethusa,
some of it not very straight business; for Ctesius, the king of
the place, had a woman-servant, very tall and comely, who was
from their own country; they cajoled her in ways that no woman
can resist and, partly by means of &ldquo;a necklace of gold with
amber beads strung among it,&rdquo; induced her to go away with
them one evening, and she took with her out of the palace three
cups and the king&rsquo;s son, a child just able to run
about.&nbsp; She may have thought of taking the boy because she
had herself been kidnapped from Sidon, brought to Ortigia and
sold to Ctesius.&nbsp; Before they had been a week on the voyage,
Diana struck the woman dead and the traders threw her body
overboard to the seals and fishes.&nbsp; We should never have
known her tragic end but for the fact that the <i>Odyssey</i> was
written by a woman jealous for the honour of her sex.&nbsp; The
boy was afterwards sold to Laertes, the father of Ulysses, in
whose service he put on immortality as the swineherd
Eum&aelig;us. <a name="citation294"></a><a href="#footnote294"
class="citation">[294]</a></p>
<p>Early Greeks also did business with Arethusa and left with her
vases, gold rings, glass beads, ivory combs and other objects
which she still preserves in her museum.&nbsp; Later on, in quite
modern days, about the time that Rome was being founded, less
than eight centuries before Christ, other Greeks came from
Corinth, turned out the Sikels and established a colony of their
own in Ortigia.</p>
<p>After this Arethusa was no longer among those who have no
history in any sense of the word.&nbsp; The records become less
scanty, even voluminous, and they are more legible.&nbsp; The
books are full of the great names of her visitors and of those
native to her island.&nbsp; We read of the Tyrants, of
&AElig;schylus and Pindar, of Theocritus and Archimedes; of <!--
page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>the great siege when the Athenians failed to take the
city; of Cicero coming to view the locality when preparing his
speeches against Verres; of the five parts into which ancient
Siracusa was divided, namely, Ortigia, on the island, and those
four others with the beautiful names on the mainland, Achradina,
Tyche, Neapolis, Epipol&aelig;, the memory of whose former
splendour still trembles among their ruins.</p>
<p>I do not know whether Ptolemy Philadelphos actually visited
the nymph, but I have read somewhere that the papyrus which now
grows where she rises was originally a present from him.&nbsp; It
does not look so healthy as that which grows in the Fontana Cyane
up the river Anapo across the harbour, and which he also sent to
her.</p>
<p>About three hundred years after the statue of Venus was made,
S. Paul, being on his way to Rome, was shipwrecked at Malta,
where he remained three months.&nbsp; He sailed away in the
<i>Castor and Pollux</i> of Alexandria, landed at Siracusa and
tarried there three days.&nbsp; We know what S. Paul must have
thought of Diana from the account of what happened at Ephesus,
where the goddess was also worshipped; it is probable that he was
among those who disbelieved in the eternal virginity of Arethusa,
and he surely must have disapproved of the frequent visits of
Venus and Cupid.&nbsp; In time the people of Ortigia professed
themselves converted to his views and made a change, but they
made it in a half-hearted way; for instead of pulling down the
heathen temple, so that not one stone should be left upon
another, they allowed the Doric columns to remain and merely
filled up the intercolumniations with building material and
baptised it into the Christian faith with a coat of whitewash and
a new name.&nbsp; In other respects they went on very much as
before.</p>
<p>Saracens visited the nymph, and Normans; Egyptians, Germans,
Goths, Spaniards, Frenchmen, Albanians all came and all
bequeathed some record of their coming.&nbsp; Many of them left
their autographs written one over the <!-- page 296--><a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>other upon
the forms and features of the ancestors of those who still have
their dwelling in her island.</p>
<p>Lord Nelson on his way to the Nile, where the papyrus came
from, sailed into the Great Harbour with his fleet and did
business with the nymph.&nbsp; He wrote to Sir William and Lady
Hamilton:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks to your exertions we have victualled and
watered; and surely, having watered at the fountain of Arethusa
we must have victory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a picture these words call up of Arethusa welcoming
Nelson&rsquo;s jolly tars!&nbsp; They are coming in their
pinnaces and filling their barrels and kegs with the waters of
the sacred spring and, as they row back across the harbour to the
ships, one can almost hear them singing of &ldquo;Tom
Bowling,&rdquo; &ldquo;Black-eyed Susan&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Roast Beef of Old England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have myself seen the German Emperor visiting Arethusa.&nbsp;
His yacht, the <i>Hohenzollern</i>, was in the Great Harbour, and
one afternoon I watched his suite being put ashore in little
boats, like Nelson&rsquo;s sailors, only there was no singing,
and presently he came in a little boat and they all drove away in
carriages to the Cappuccini, where I read in the <i>Giornale di
Sicilia</i> that they inspected the latomia and took tea.&nbsp;
They passed quite close to me and, although I had never seen His
Majesty before, I was bold enough to raise my hat to him; he
observed my salute and most affably returned it.&nbsp; I thought
him looking extremely well.</p>
<p>The Kaiser landed at the Passeggiata Aretusa, a promenade that
runs under shady trees between the Great Harbour and the cliff on
which the city is built.&nbsp; It leads south to a garden, and
further progress appears to be blocked by a buttress of the
cliff; but the buttress is pierced by a tunnel, through which a
path leads to another garden lying in an enclosure protected from
the harbour by a wall which encircles it; the wall slopes down
and on the top of it runs a path up which one can <!-- page
297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>walk and so enter the town without returning through
the tunnel.</p>
<p>In this enclosure is the famous Fontana Aretusa, but there is
nothing about it that reminds one of the fountains of the Crystal
Palace or of Versailles.&nbsp; One first catches sight of a pond
and then of a spring bubbling into it with irresistible
volubility at the north end; at the south end the water tumbles
out into the harbour through a hole in the sea wall.&nbsp; The
surface of the pond is below the level of the passeggiata and
probably the bed of it is below the level of the water in the
harbour, so that, as Cicero observed, it is the wall that keeps
out the waves and if the hole had been pierced lower the pond
would be submerged by the sea.&nbsp; On the sides of the cliff
and on the wall grow plants with aromatic leaves and flowers, and
one can walk round the pond and watch the fish which are, or
ought to be, the descendants of those which Cicero saw, as they
swim about among the roots of Ptolemy&rsquo;s papyrus.&nbsp; The
water is not now used for washing, but I suspect that the
Sidonian woman who stole the little Eum&aelig;us was so using it,
for she was washing near the ship of her countrymen when they got
into conversation with her, and their ship would be moored in the
Great Harbour, close by the fountain.</p>
<p>I drank of this water, following the example of all visitors
and of many of the inhabitants who believe it to produce a
beneficial effect upon the digestion.&nbsp; It may have been good
enough for Nelson, and I trust that the digestions of his sailors
derived benefit from it&mdash;anyhow, they had victory at the
battle of the Nile&mdash;but for a modern Londoner, accustomed to
do business with the Metropolitan Water Board, it is too salt,
which is perhaps why the papyrus here looks less flourishing than
that up the Anapo.&nbsp; The water tastes as though Arethusa had
been the heroine of another story besides the one with the
uncertain ending about Alpheus&mdash;one with Neptune as the
villain and an ending tragic enough to justify S. Paul in his
<!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>attitude towards the nymph.&nbsp; Some who adopt this
view suppose that Neptune&rsquo;s designs were forwarded by an
earthquake which, they think, must have occurred since
Nelson&rsquo;s time, because he speaks as though he gave his
sailors the water of the spring; but that is not enough to date
the disturbance.&nbsp; It is some distance from Greece to Sicily,
and along all those miles, during all those ages, there may have
been many earthquakes, any one of which would have served
Neptune&rsquo;s turn; some may have been before S. Paul&rsquo;s
time, some before Eum&aelig;us was born, some in still earlier
days.&nbsp; If the earthquake had already been, Nelson must have
observed the brackishness of the spring and he would then have
preferred to take his water from the usual fresh source which
supplied the inhabitants of his day, and, in speaking of
&ldquo;having watered at the fountain of Arethusa,&rdquo; he
would be trusting to Lady Hamilton&rsquo;s familiarity with that
figure which permits the part to be put for the whole.</p>
<p>I have visited Arethusa many times.&nbsp; Once, on a calm
evening in early summer, Diana was high up in the sky, shining
over the harbour; although, like others, she may not have been
sure which was her temple and which was Minerva&rsquo;s, she
could not help wondering whether anything was ever going to be
done about openly restoring them both to their ancient
worship.&nbsp; She was, however, comforting herself in the
meantime with the reflection that neither she nor Minerva had
much to complain of, inasmuch as it was clear that if it were not
for the support of those Doric columns the modern Church would
not stand as it does, and after all, she thought,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo;&nbsp; Down below in the
passeggiata, officers and young men were strolling about,
listening to a pot-pourri of <i>Faust</i>.&nbsp; Their cheeks
were shaved smooth to show the modelling and their moustaches
gave evidence of hours of toil and even suffering; they met their
friends and gesticulated with them, smoking cigarettes and being
polite to everyone.&nbsp; Mothers and elder sisters in cool white
dresses sat under the trees, <!-- page 299--><a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>and little
parties of children darted away from them, hand in hand,
returning after breathless excursions.&nbsp; I took a seat among
it all and, as the King of Thule, in honour of his lady, was
drinking for the last time out of his golden cup, a young voice
over my shoulder demanded two soldi.&nbsp; I turned and thought I
recognised the speaker; surely he must have left his dolphin in
the Great Harbour where the Ph&oelig;nician traders used to moor
their ships, and put on his sailor suit at the Custom House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Cupid,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mind giving you two soldi, but why do you ask as
though you were entitled to them?&nbsp; And why do you wear that
red tam-o&rsquo;-shanter?&nbsp; And how old are you, if you
please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he was seven and the cap was his uniform; he was
collecting the pennies for the chairs.&nbsp; So I gave him two
soldi and another for himself and saw him scamper happily away
and join a knot of brother Cupids who were playing together round
a lamp-post.&nbsp; He showed them the soldo I had given him for
himself and the meeting became as ebullient and full of
excitement as the Arethusa herself.</p>
<p>He reappeared while Siebel, with the voice of a clarinet, was
beginning to tell the flowers what they were to say to
Margherita.&nbsp; This time he brought a foreign penny and wanted
to know why they had refused to take it at the marionette
theatre.&nbsp; I looked at it and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to know about this coin, mount your dolphin
again and direct his course to distant Argentina, the people of
that country will tell you all about it and will give you its
full value.&nbsp; You will have a delightful voyage and, if I
were not such a bad sailor, I believe I should ask you to take me
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed, however, that his dolphin was tired and I was to
give him ten centimes down and done with it.&nbsp; He was such a
jolly little fellow that just for the pleasure of seeing him
smile again I gave him the soldi in exchange for his coin and he
danced away in delight.</p>
<p>Margherita in prison was crazily recalling the strains of <!--
page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>the waltz she had heard&mdash;Ah, what ages ago it
seemed!&mdash;when she was yet a happy girl, as pure as Arethusa
in Hellas, and through the waltz I heard the young voice again
over my shoulder.&nbsp; He was asking me to give him bronze for
an Italian nickel piece of twenty centesimi.&nbsp; It was a bad
one.&nbsp; I told him so and accused him of attempting to utter
counterfeit coin.&nbsp; He laid his two hands on his breast,
raised his elbows, threw back his head with conscious innocence
and swore on the honour of his mother that the coin was
good.&nbsp; He did it so well&mdash;so beautifully&mdash;that for
a moment I was tempted to wonder whether he might perhaps be
speaking the truth, but I glanced again at his coin and recovered
myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Cupid,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to breathe a syllable against the honour of your
mother, but you know better than anyone that when a woman loses
her head you are generally to blame.&nbsp; This is your
doing&rdquo;&mdash;and I took out of my pocket and showed him a
post-card I had bought that morning in the Via Roma with a
reproduction of the Venere Anadiomene.&nbsp; &ldquo;And men also
have lost their heads because of you.&nbsp; I am not the only one
who has heard about the Duca di Bronte and Lady Hamilton.&nbsp;
Look round at these beautiful ladies and at these brave officers
and young men&mdash;do they not bear upon their forms and
features the signatures of Arethusa&rsquo;s foreign
visitors?&nbsp; You ought to be able to decipher that palimpsest,
if anyone can, for it was you who taught them to write; Ortigia
would never have seen them if it had not been for you.&nbsp; And
why are they sitting under the trees and walking about in the
moonlight, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied that they had come out to listen to the music and
he wished there were more of them because then he would get more
pennies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;people who do not even
recognise a modulation to the dominant when they hear one come
out to listen to music!&nbsp; You know better than that.&nbsp;
They have not come out because of Gounod, they <!-- page 301--><a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>have come
because of you.&nbsp; It is always the same old story.&nbsp; It
was your fault that Alpheus chased Arethusa out of Greece and
that Proserpine was carried off from Enna.&nbsp; It was you who
suggested to those Ph&oelig;nician traders that the nurse of the
little Eum&aelig;us would be good company for them, and you who
made her consent to go.&nbsp; This music, of which I should have
heard more this evening but for your frequent interruptions, you
were at the bottom of it all.&nbsp; And it is because you are
always hanging about the theatre that those wretched puppets are
so constantly going mad for love of one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pouted and said I was making myself disagreeable and that
there had been plenty to praise him.</p>
<p>I replied: &ldquo;Yes; you swallow the praise, but you
won&rsquo;t listen to the blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said that as for the praise or the blame it was nothing to
him one way or the other.&nbsp; He was too much interested in the
future of the race to care about any of those old
stories&mdash;they bored him&mdash;and, please, wouldn&rsquo;t I
leave off preaching and give him four soldi?</p>
<p>I replied: &ldquo;You have immortal youth without the
troublesome necessity of periodically dying and rising again; on
that stage of the world where we mortals, untrained amateurs,
improvise the drama of our lives, you have always been behind the
scenes, inspiring and stage-managing more history and more poetry
than has ever been written; without you Clio would never have
built herself a treasure-house or, if she had made one, her
sisters would have found in it nothing worth stealing; it is you
who direct the modulation from the old generation to the young;
it is your voice that is heard every Easter behind the bells and
the music of the Gloria.&nbsp; And now you ask for riches!&nbsp;
No wonder we complain that you are unreasonable.&nbsp; Can you
not be satisfied and, in looking after the future of the race,
put a little more variety into its history and its poetry?&nbsp;
Why do you so often begin a story as comedy and end it as
tragedy?&nbsp; It is unworthy of you to play fast and <!-- page
302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>loose with us; great poets do not do so.&nbsp; But
there! you are too young to know what conscience is, and I am
afraid you are too old to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied that he was not accustomed to be talked to in this
way and did not know what I meant by it.</p>
<p>I said: &ldquo;Very well, I will leave off preaching, and
perhaps you will allow me to conclude with a piece of advice that
ought to be acceptable to one whose ambition it is to become a
millionaire.&nbsp; You cannot have forgotten where you put your
mother&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Now, be a sensible boy for once, run
away and find it, take it to Dr. Orsi up there in the museum and
he will give you plenty of soldi for it&mdash;more than you can
count, and no questions asked about honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed and said I seemed to take a good deal of interest
in the personal appearance of his mother who, he thought, could
be trusted to look after herself, and that so long as a
woman&rsquo;s heart was in the right place it did not much matter
what she did with her head.&nbsp; Besides, even if he were to
find the head, he knew nothing about business and a scientific
man in a museum would be sure to get the better of him.</p>
<p>There is no resisting Cupid, so I let him think he had got the
better of me, gave him four soldi and added his coin to my
collection of similar pieces, while he frisked away back to his
friends boasting of his success, as Cupid will.&nbsp; He had not
quite done with me, however, he came once more to see whether I
should be likely to give him a cigarette, but a rough man caught
him, told him not to worry the gentry, boxed his ears for him and
drove him from me.</p>
<p>Fancy boxing the ears of a young Greek god off a
dolphin&rsquo;s back within sound of the Fontana Aretusa!</p>
<p>And yet, perhaps the rough man was right.&nbsp; I have
sometimes thought since that it cannot have been really Cupid who
came to me that evening; I must have been wasting my time and
money, as others have done before, upon some false god, false as
his counterfeit coin, one of those who go <!-- page 303--><a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>up and down
the world seeking whom they may despoil.&nbsp; Well, let it be
so.&nbsp; One does not keep an account of the hours and minutes
one spends in a country where the existence of time is scarcely
recognised, and as for the money&mdash;of all the multitudes of
men who have been fooled by Commerce in the guise of Love only a
few have had the luck to escape with a total loss not exceeding
four-pence half-penny.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
